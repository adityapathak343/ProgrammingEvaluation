  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Incorrect handling of player role check and syntax errors.
    max_score: 5
    score: 1
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but incorrect handling of the filtered list
      and division by zero potential.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Syntax errors in the compare method. Use parentheses for method calls
      and correct the if-else structure.
    max_score: 2
    score: 0
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but missing exception handling
      for player creation and incorrect data type handling.
    max_score: 9
    score: 5
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Incorrect use of iterator and missing exception handling.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but incorrect use of iterator and missing exception
      handling for player not found.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Syntax errors in the PrintWriter initialization and missing exception
      handling.
    max_score: 4
    score: 2
overall_feedback: The code contains several syntax errors and logical issues that
  need to be addressed. Focus on correcting method implementations and ensuring proper
  exception handling.

  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but string comparison should use .equals()
      instead of '=='.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but initialization of total runs variable is
      missing.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but there are issues with reading
      player data and handling exceptions.
    max_score: 9
    score: 6
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but string comparison should use .equals()
      instead of '=='.
    max_score: 5

  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but string comparison should use .equals()
      instead of '=='.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Correctly writes player data but does not handle file closure properly.
    max_score: 4
    score: 3
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several issues with string comparison and file handling that need
  to be addressed.

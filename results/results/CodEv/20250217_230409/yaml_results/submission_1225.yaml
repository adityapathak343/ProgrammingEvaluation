  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering all-rounders is incorrect; unnecessary nested loop.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic for calculating average runs is incorrect; total runs calculation
      is flawed.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is partially implemented. Issues with tokenization
      and player object creation.
    max_score: 9
    score: 5
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Filtering logic is mostly correct, but string comparison should use
      equals method.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but string comparison should
      use equals method.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Method is incomplete; no player data is written to the file.
    max_score: 4
    score: 0
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several logical errors and incomplete methods that need to be addressed.

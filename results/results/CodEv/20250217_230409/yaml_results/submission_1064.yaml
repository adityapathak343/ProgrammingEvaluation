  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented filtering logic for all-rounders.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but division by zero should be handled.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but player name concatenation
      is incorrect.
    max_score: 9
    score: 7
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering players by team is mostly correct, but should use
      .equals() for string comparison.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but player name comparison
      should use .equals() instead of ==.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Column names are not written correctly, missing commas between player
      details.
    max_score: 4
    score: 2
overall_feedback: The implementation is mostly correct but has some issues with string
  comparisons and file writing format. Attention to detail is needed in handling edge
  cases.

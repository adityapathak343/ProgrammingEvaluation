  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: The method is not implemented. Needs to filter all-rounders based on
      specified criteria.

    max_score: 9
    score: 0
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The method is partially implemented but uses '==' for string comparison
      instead of '.equals()'.
    max_score: 5

    feedback: The method partially implements player stats update but lacks exception
      handling for when no player matches.
    max_score: 5

    feedback: The method is not implemented. Needs to write player data back to a
      file.
    max_score: 4
    score: 0
overall_feedback: The implementation shows some understanding of the requirements,
  but several methods are incomplete or incorrect. Focus on completing the missing
  methods and fixing the errors in the existing ones.

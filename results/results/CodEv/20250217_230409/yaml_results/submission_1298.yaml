  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: The filter method is not implemented at all.
    max_score: 5
    score: 0
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: The method does not correctly filter players by team or calculate the
      average runs. The logic for checking team names is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 1
  compare:
    feedback: The compare method is incorrectly implemented. The syntax for accessing
      player runs is incorrect. Use p1.getRunsScored() and p2.getRunsScored() instead.
    max_score: 2
    score: 0
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: The method initializes a list and attempts to read from a file, but
      it does not correctly handle reading lines or creating Player objects. The logic
      for reading lines and splitting them is missing.
    max_score: 9
    score: 2
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The filter method is not implemented at all.
    max_score: 5
    score: 0
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: The method does not correctly iterate through the players list or update
      the player's stats. The logic for checking player names is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 1
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: The method attempts to write player data but does not iterate through
      the players list correctly. The output format is not properly implemented.
    max_score: 4
    score: 1
overall_feedback: The code has several incomplete methods and incorrect implementations.
  Focus on correctly implementing the logic for reading, writing, and filtering player
  data.

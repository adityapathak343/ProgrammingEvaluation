  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but return statement is incorrectly placed
      inside the loop.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but exception handling could be improved.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but missing player addition to
      the list and file closing.
    max_score: 9
    score: 6
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Filtering logic is incorrect; it should not throw an exception if no
      players match.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic is correct, but string comparison should use .equals() instead
      of ==.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Successfully implemented writing players to file.
    max_score: 4
    score: 4
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several logical errors and missing parts that need to be addressed
  for full functionality.

  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: The filtering logic is mostly correct, but the conditions should use
      '>=' instead of '>' for inclusive filtering.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the calculation of average runs for a team.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs in descending order.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: Successfully implemented most steps, but did not handle the file closing
      properly in all scenarios.
    max_score: 9
    score: 8
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The filtering logic is incorrect; should use .equals() for string comparison
      instead of '==' operator.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but the exception handling
      for player not found is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Wrote the column names correctly, but the loop for writing player data
      has an off-by-one error.
    max_score: 4
    score: 2
overall_feedback: The implementation is mostly correct but contains several logical
  errors and issues with string comparison. Focus on proper exception handling and
  ensure correct loop boundaries.

  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: The method correctly filters all-rounders based on the specified criteria.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: The method calculates the average runs but does not handle the case
      where no players belong to the specified team, which should throw an IllegalArgumentException.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: The compare method does not return the correct values for descending
      order. It should return a negative value if the first player has more runs,
      a positive value if the second player has more runs, or zero if they have the
      same number of runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 0
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: The method correctly reads player data from the file but does not handle
      the case where the file does not exist properly. It also does not return an
      empty list if the file is empty.
    max_score: 9
    score: 7
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The method correctly filters players by team.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: The method updates player statistics correctly but does not throw an
      IllegalArgumentException if no player matches the given name.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: The method correctly writes player data to the file in the required
      format.
    max_score: 4
    score: 4
overall_feedback: The implementation is mostly correct but has some issues with error
  handling and the compare method logic. Focus on improving these areas.

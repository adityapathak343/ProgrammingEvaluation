  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but the role check should use the enum instead
      of string comparison.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Correctly calculates average runs, but division by zero should be handled
      if no players are found.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs in descending order.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: Successfully implemented most steps, but the line splitting logic is
      incorrect (should use a comma instead of space).
    max_score: 9
    score: 6
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Correctly filters players by team, but missing exception handling for
      empty results.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating player stats is mostly correct, but missing exception
      handling for player not found.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: File writing logic is incomplete; missing writing player details and
      closing the writer.
    max_score: 4
    score: 1
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several areas for improvement, particularly in error handling and
  data parsing.

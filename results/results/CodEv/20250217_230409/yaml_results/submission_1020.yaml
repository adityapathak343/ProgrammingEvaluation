  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering all-rounders is mostly correct, but role comparison
      is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic for calculating average runs is mostly correct, but team name
      comparison is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but player creation has issues.
    max_score: 9
    score: 5
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering by team is mostly correct, but team name comparison
      is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but player name comparison
      is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: File writing logic is incorrect; BufferedWriter is not instantiated
      properly.
    max_score: 4
    score: 2
overall_feedback: The implementation has several logical errors, particularly in string
  comparisons and file handling. Review the comparison methods and ensure proper object
  instantiation.

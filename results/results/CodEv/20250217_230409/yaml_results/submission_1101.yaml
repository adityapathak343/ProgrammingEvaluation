  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Successfully implemented the filtering logic for all-rounders based
      on criteria.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Correctly filtered players and calculated average, but division should
      be handled as a double to avoid integer division.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs in descending order.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: Successfully implemented most steps, but the line splitting and reading
      logic is incorrect. Use nextLine() and split() for proper parsing.
    max_score: 9
    score: 7
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Successfully implemented the filtering logic for players by team.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but the exception is thrown
      incorrectly inside the loop.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Wrote the column names correctly, but did not add new line after each
      player's data.
    max_score: 4
    score: 3
overall_feedback: The implementation is mostly correct with some minor issues in file
  reading/writing and exception handling. Focus on improving the parsing logic and
  ensuring proper output formatting.

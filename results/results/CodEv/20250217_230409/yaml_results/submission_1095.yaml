  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for all-rounders based on
      criteria.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic for filtering players is incomplete. The total runs calculation
      and average return are missing.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: Successfully created a list and read data, but splitting the line is
      incorrect. Use split(',') instead of split('') to correctly parse CSV.
    max_score: 9
    score: 6
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for players by team.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is mostly correct, but the handling of the
      'yes' variable is flawed. It should be initialized to false and set to true
      only when a match is found.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Wrote player details correctly but did not close the PrintWriter after
      writing.
    max_score: 4
    score: 3
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several areas for improvement, particularly in file handling and logic
  completeness.

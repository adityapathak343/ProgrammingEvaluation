  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented filtering logic for all-rounders.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but team name comparison should use .equals()
      instead of ==, and division by 11 should be dynamic.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but splitting lines by space instead
      of comma may lead to errors.
    max_score: 9
    score: 7
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but team name comparison should use .equals()
      instead of ==.
    max_score: 5
    score: 3
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but string comparison should use .equals()
      instead of ==.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Correctly writes player data, but the column names are not formatted
      correctly.
    max_score: 4
    score: 3
overall_feedback: The implementation is mostly correct but contains some issues with
  string comparison and file reading format. Attention to detail is needed for correct
  functionality.

  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering all-rounders is incorrect; 'itr.next' should be
      'itr.next()' and 'getRunsScored()' and 'getWicketsTaken()' should be checked
      correctly.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic for filtering players and calculating average runs is incorrect;
      'getteamName()' should be 'getTeamName()' and 'Iterator' usage is incorrect.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: 'The method has several issues: ''Open'' and ''Close'' methods are incorrectly
      used, ''readLine'' should be ''readLine()'', and parsing logic is incorrect.'
    max_score: 9
    score: 5
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering players is incorrect; 'itr.next' should be 'itr.next()'
      and 'getteamName()' should be 'getTeamName()'.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is incorrect; 'Iterator.next()' is called multiple
      times without storing the player reference.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Method not implemented.
    max_score: 4
    score: 0
overall_feedback: The implementation has several logical and syntactical errors that
  need to be addressed. Focus on correcting the method implementations and ensuring
  proper usage of iterators and method calls.

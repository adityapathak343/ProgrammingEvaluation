  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: The method is not implemented. It needs to filter all-rounders based
      on the given criteria.
    max_score: 5
    score: 0
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: The method is not implemented. It needs to filter players by team and
      calculate the average runs.
    max_score: 5
    score: 0
  compare:
    feedback: The comparison logic is mostly correct, but the return values for positive
      and negative cases are not implemented correctly. Use 'return -1' for more runs
      and 'return 1' for fewer runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: The method does not correctly read player data from the file. It needs
      to implement file reading, line skipping, and player object creation.
    max_score: 9
    score: 2
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The method is not implemented. It needs to filter players based on the
      team name.
    max_score: 5
    score: 0
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: The method attempts to update player stats but has issues with variable
      scope and logic. Ensure to iterate through the player list and update correctly.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: The method prepares to write data but does not implement writing player
      details correctly. Ensure to write each player's information in the correct
      format.
    max_score: 4
    score: 1
overall_feedback: The implementation is incomplete and contains several logical errors.
  Focus on correctly implementing the file handling and filtering methods.

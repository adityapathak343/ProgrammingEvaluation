  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Logic for filtering all-rounders is incorrect; uses wrong condition
      for checking runs and wickets.
    max_score: 5
    score: 2
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Average calculation is mostly correct but lacks exception handling for
      no players.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is partially implemented. The line parsing and player
      creation are incorrect.

    score: 4
  teamFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for teams.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: Logic for updating stats is incomplete and does not throw exceptions
      as required.

  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: Method is not implemented.
    max_score: 4
    score: 0
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but several methods need significant improvements, especially in file handling and
  exception management.

  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Logic is mostly correct, but needs to use .equals() for string comparison.

    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.

    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: File reading logic is mostly correct, but needs to handle parsing of
      integers and roles properly.

overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in handling exceptions
  and string comparisons.

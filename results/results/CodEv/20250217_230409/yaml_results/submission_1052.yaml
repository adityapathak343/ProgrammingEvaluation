  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for all-rounders.
    max_score: 5
    score: 5
  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: The method calculates average runs but does not handle the case where
      no players are found.

    score: 3
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: The method attempts to read from a file but has issues with line handling
      and player creation.
    max_score: 9
    score: 3
  teamFilter:
    feedback: The filtering logic is mostly correct but uses '==' for string comparison
      instead of '.equals()'.
    max_score: 5
    score: 4
  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: The method is not implemented.
    max_score: 5

  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: The method starts writing to a file but does not complete the implementation.
    max_score: 4
    score: 1
overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but several methods need completion and error handling.

  updatePlayerStats:
    feedback: The method partially implements the logic but lacks proper exception
      handling and does not throw an exception when no player matches.

  writePlayersToFile:
    feedback: The method is incomplete and does not write player data to the file
      as required.
    max_score: 4

overall_feedback: The implementation is incomplete with several methods not fully
  implemented. Focus on completing the methods for reading, writing, filtering, and
  calculating statistics.

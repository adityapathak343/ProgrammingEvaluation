  allRounderFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for all-rounders based on
      criteria.

  calculateTeamAverageRuns:
    feedback: Partially implemented. Logic to calculate average runs is present, but
      missing exception handling for no players found.

    score: 2
  compare:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the comparison logic for runs in descending order.
    max_score: 2
    score: 2
  readPlayersFromFile:
    feedback: Incomplete implementation. Missing logic to read player data, create
      Player objects, and return the list.

  teamFilter:
    feedback: Correctly implemented the filtering logic for players by team.

    feedback: Partially implemented. Logic to update stats is correct, but exception
      handling for player not found is incorrect.

overall_feedback: The implementation shows a good understanding of the requirements,
  but several methods are incomplete or have issues that need to be addressed.

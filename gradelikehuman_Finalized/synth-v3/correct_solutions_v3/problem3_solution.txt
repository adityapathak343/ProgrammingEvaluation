Below is a complete solution to the problem statement provided. The script declares variables with appropriate data types, performs operations to update and calculate inventory values, and includes optional user input functionality.


# inventory_manager.py

# Step 1: Declare Variables
# Declaring a variable for each piece of product information
product_name = "Wireless Mouse"  # String to store the product's name
product_price = 25.99            # Float to store the product's price
product_quantity = 50            # Integer to store the product's quantity
product_on_sale = False          # Boolean to indicate if the product is on sale

# Step 2: Display Product Information
# Printing product information in a user-friendly format
print("Product Name:", product_name)
print("Product Price: ${:.2f}".format(product_price))
print("Product Quantity:", product_quantity)
print("Product On Sale:", "Yes" if product_on_sale else "No")

# Step 3: Calculate Total Value of Inventory
# Calculating the total inventory value and storing it in a variable
total_inventory_value = product_price * product_quantity
# Printing the total inventory value with a descriptive message
print("Total Inventory Value: ${:.2f}".format(total_inventory_value))

# Step 4: Update Inventory
# Simulating a sale where 5 units are sold and updating the quantity
units_sold = 5
product_quantity -= units_sold  # Updating the product quantity
# Printing the new quantity after the sale
print("Updated Product Quantity:", product_quantity)

# Step 5: Check Sale Status
# Checking if the product is on sale and printing an appropriate message
if product_on_sale:
    print("This product is currently on sale! Enjoy the discount.")
else:
    print("This product is sold at regular price.")

# Additional Challenge: Allow user input for product information
# Uncomment the lines below to get user input instead of using hardcoded values
# product_name = input("Enter the product name: ")
# product_price = float(input("Enter the product price: "))
# product_quantity = int(input("Enter the product quantity: "))
# product_on_sale = input("Is the product on sale (yes/no)? ").strip().lower() == 'yes'

Here's a 10-point rubric for evaluating the Library Management System project:

1. **Functionality of Main Menu (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The main menu is implemented correctly, allowing users to select and navigate between different operations seamlessly.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The main menu is implemented but has minor issues in navigation or user interaction.
   - No Marks (0 points): The main menu is missing or non-functional.

2. **Implementation of `add_book` Function (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The function correctly adds a book to the collection and returns the updated collection.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The function adds a book but has issues with returning the updated collection or handling inputs.
   - No Marks (0 points): The function is missing or does not add books correctly.

3. **Implementation of `remove_book` Function (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The function correctly removes a book by title and returns the appropriate boolean status.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The function removes a book but has issues with returning the correct status or handling non-existent books.
   - No Marks (0 points): The function is missing or does not remove books correctly.

4. **Implementation of `search_book` Function (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The function correctly searches for a book by title and returns the book details if found.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The function searches for a book but has issues with returning details or handling non-existent books.
   - No Marks (0 points): The function is missing or does not search books correctly.

5. **Implementation of `list_books` Function (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The function correctly lists all books in the collection.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The function lists books but has issues with formatting or handling an empty collection.
   - No Marks (0 points): The function is missing or does not list books correctly.

6. **Use of Data Structure (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): Books are stored using a list of dictionaries with correct keys (`title`, `author`, `year`).
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): Books are stored using a list of dictionaries but with minor issues in structure or key usage.
   - No Marks (0 points): Books are not stored using the specified data structure.

7. **User Input Handling (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): User input is handled effectively with appropriate prompts and validation for all operations.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): User input is handled but lacks validation or has minor issues with prompts.
   - No Marks (0 points): User input handling is inadequate or missing.

8. **Variable Scope and Reusability (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): Variables are properly scoped, and functions are reusable without unnecessary global variables.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): Variables are mostly scoped correctly, but some global variables are used unnecessarily.
   - No Marks (0 points): Variable scope is poorly managed, with excessive use of global variables.

9. **Return Values (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): Functions return appropriate values based on their operations, facilitating correct program flow.
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): Functions return values but with inconsistencies or minor issues affecting program flow.
   - No Marks (0 points): Functions do not return appropriate values, disrupting program flow.

10. **Code Clarity and Organization (1 point)**
    - Full Marks (1 point): Code is well-organized, with clear structure, comments, and naming conventions.
    - Partial Marks (0.5 points): Code is mostly organized but lacks comments or has inconsistent naming conventions.
    - No Marks (0 points): Code is poorly organized, making it difficult to understand or follow.

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the project is evaluated based on its contribution to the overall functionality and quality of the Library Management System.

Creating a detailed grading rubric for the "Treasure Hunt" problem statement involves breaking down the task into specific criteria that reflect the learning objectives and expected outcomes. Here's a 10-point rubric designed to evaluate the solution:

1. **Correctness of Treasure Identification (2 points)**
   - **2 points**: The program correctly identifies all treasure locations on the map.
   - **1 point**: The program identifies some but not all treasures, or includes incorrect locations.
   - **0 points**: The program fails to identify any treasures or produces incorrect results.

2. **Correctness of Treasure Sorting (2 points)**
   - **2 points**: The program correctly sorts all identified treasure values in ascending order.
   - **1 point**: The program sorts some treasures correctly but not all, or the order is partially incorrect.
   - **0 points**: The program fails to sort the treasures or produces an incorrect order.

3. **Efficiency of Search Algorithm (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The search algorithm is efficient and appropriate for the problem size (e.g., linear traversal of the grid).
   - **0 points**: The search algorithm is inefficient or inappropriate, leading to unnecessary complexity or performance issues.

4. **Efficiency of Sorting Algorithm (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The sorting algorithm is efficient and appropriate for the problem size (e.g., using Python's built-in sort).
   - **0 points**: The sorting algorithm is inefficient or inappropriate, leading to unnecessary complexity or performance issues.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as maps with no treasures or maps where all cells contain treasures.
   - **0 points**: The program fails to handle edge cases, resulting in errors or incorrect outputs.

6. **Code Quality and Organization (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The code is well-organized, with clear structure and logical flow.
   - **0 points**: The code is poorly organized, making it difficult to follow or understand.

7. **Variable Naming and Readability (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: Variables are named clearly and descriptively, enhancing code readability.
   - **0 points**: Variables are poorly named, making the code difficult to read and understand.

8. **Documentation and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The code is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and flow.
   - **0 points**: The code lacks sufficient comments, making it difficult to understand the logic.

9. **Input and Output Handling (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly handles input and output as specified, including formatting.
   - **0 points**: The program fails to handle input or output correctly, or the format is incorrect.

10. **Testing and Validation (1 point)**
    - **1 point**: The solution includes tests with various grid configurations to ensure correctness.
    - **0 points**: The solution lacks testing, or tests are insufficient to validate correctness.

This rubric ensures that the evaluation is comprehensive, covering all aspects of the problem statement, from algorithmic correctness and efficiency to code quality and robustness.

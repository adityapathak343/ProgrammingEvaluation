problem10_statement,problem10-0pt.txt,6,"### Feedback:

1. **Correctness:** 
   - The student identifies treasures using list comprehension, which can be a concise and efficient approach. However, they use an incorrect condition (`value > 1` instead of `value > 0`), leading to missing treasures valued at 1.
   - The function is supposed to return the total number of treasures found, but it returns the number of rows in the grid instead.

2. **Sorting Algorithm:**
   - The student did not implement a sorting step. Based on the problem requirements, after identifying treasures, their values need to be sorted in ascending order.

3. **Code Quality:**
   - The code is clean and concise, with adequate use of list comprehension, but lacks comments explaining the logic.
   - Output formatting could be improved to exactly match the requirement of separated treasure values.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of list comprehension is efficient, but failing to sort treasure values means the core functionality of sorting is missing.

5. **Robustness:**
   - The student code does not seem to handle edge cases, such as when no treasures are found.

### Recommendations:

- **Correct the condition** in the list comprehension to include treasures with a value of 1.
- **Implement a sorting algorithm** to sort the treasure values in ascending order before returning them.
- **Return the correct number of treasures** found instead of the number of grid rows.

",4,"### Evaluation of Student Code

**Correctness:**
- **Issue Identified**: The comprehension used for extracting treasure values filters out values equal to `1`. This leads to incorrect results if there are treasures with a value of `1`, as seen in the test case.
- **Missing Sorting Step**: The student did not sort the list of treasures, failing to meet the problem requirements.
- **Incorrect Output for Number of Treasures**: The student returns the length of the grid instead of the number of treasures found.

**Code Quality:**
- The student did use a list comprehension effectively but misapplied the condition.
- Output statements in the 'main' function should clearly label the type of output consistent with the problem statement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Correct the Filtering Logic**:
   - Update the list comprehension to include values greater than `0`, which corresponds to all treasures:  
     ```python
     treasure_values = [value for row in grid for value in row if value > 0]
     ```

2. **Sort the Treasure Values**:
   - Ensure the extracted treasure values are sorted before returning:  
     ```python
     treasure_values.sort()
     ```

3. **Calculate the Correct Number of Treasures**:
   - Return the length of the `treasure_values` list to reflect the correct number of treasures:  
     ```python
     return len(treasure_values), treasure_values
     ```

4. **Output Format**:
   - Align the output format more closely to the example and requirements:  
     ```python
     print(len(sorted_treasures))  # This should be the count of treasures
     print(' '.join(map(str, sorted_treasures)))  # Sorted values
     ```

**Edge Cases and Testing:**
- Consider testing with grid configurations covering various edge cases, such as all zeros, all treasures, or rows of varying lengths (within constraint limits).

Given these aspects, I would rate the student's attempt as **4/10**. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance both correctness and code quality.","

## Problem Statement: Treasure Hunt

### Background:
Welcome to the world of ""Treasure Hunt,"" a game where players search for hidden treasures on a map. The map is a grid consisting of various locations, each of which might contain a treasure. Your task is to assist the treasure hunters by developing an efficient algorithm to locate these treasures using basic searching and sorting techniques.

### Objective:
Design a program that helps identify the location of treasures on a map using searching algorithms. Once the treasures are found, sort them based on their value to help players decide the best treasures to collect.

### Problem Details:

1. **Map Representation:**
   - The map is represented as a two-dimensional grid (list of lists in Python) with dimensions `n x m` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.
   - Each cell in the grid contains an integer value representing either an empty spot (`0`) or a treasure with a certain value (positive integer).

2. **Input:**
   - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the map.
   - The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers, representing the grid. Each integer is either `0` (no treasure) or a positive integer (value of the treasure).

3. **Output:**
   - The first line should output the total number of treasures found on the map.
   - The second line should output the list of treasure values in ascending order.

4. **Algorithm Requirements:**
   - Implement a search algorithm to traverse the grid and locate all the treasures.
   - Use a sorting algorithm to arrange the treasure values in ascending order.
   - The choice of searching and sorting algorithms is up to you, but consider efficiency and clarity.

### Example:

#### Input:

3 4
0 5 0 0
4 0 0 3
0 0 1 0

"
problem10_statement,problem10-2pt.txt,6,"The student code provides a partial solution to the problem but contains a significant flaw. Here's a detailed evaluation:

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Correctness**:
   - The student code correctly initiates the traversal of the grid and identifies treasures based on values > 0.
   - However, it fails to append these treasure values into the `treasure_values` list. As a result, the program will incorrectly output an empty list of treasures after sorting.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The student's code also correctly sorts the `treasure_values` list. However, since the list is never populated, the sorting step is redundant and ineffective.
   - The chosen traversal and sorting mechanisms are acceptable in terms of efficiency given the constraints of the problem.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - The code is organized, and the logic is presented in a readable format.
   - Variable names like `treasure_count` and `treasure_values` are informative and easy to understand.
   - There are no comments in the student’s code explaining its structure and logic, which reduces code clarity.

4. **Robustness**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where the grid has treasures with a value of `0` explicitly because such cases do not exist by the problem definition.
   - The primary issue is that the code's output does not accurately reflect the grid's actual treasures, meaning potential edge cases regarding empty maps won't be correctly handled.

### Recommendations:
- **Bug Fix**: Modify the inner for-loop to append the values of identified treasures to the `treasure_values` list.
- **Documentation**: Add comments to document the code logic and flow, making it easier for others to understand and maintain.
- **Testing**: After fixing the bug, conduct thorough testing with different grid configurations to ensure all edge cases are accounted for and the program works as expected in all scenarios.

### Score Justification:
The student understands the basic logic required but missed a key component in implementing the solution correctly. Therefore, the solution earns a score of **6** with room for improvement in both completeness and code documentation.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"**Evaluation of Student Code:**

**Correctness:**
- The student code correctly increments the `treasure_count` when a treasure (positive integer) is found.
- However, the student failed to append the found treasure values to the `treasure_values` list, which results in an empty list that contains no treasure values.

**Efficiency:**
- The code uses a nested loop to traverse the 2D grid, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The sort operation is performed on an empty list, which is a minor inefficiency since it does not impact the actual performance.

**Code Quality:**
- Code is mostly clear and structured correctly with appropriate use of whitespace and logical separation of concerns.
- Variable names are appropriately chosen, conveying their purpose.
- Comment usage could be improved to aid clarity, though in this case, it's clear what the student's intention was.

**Robustness:**
- Does not handle the output of an empty `treasure_values` correctly due to lack of treasure entries.
- The code seems to handle maps with no treasures and maps where all cells contain treasures correctly, except that it won't list out any treasure values.

**Recommendations to Fix Issues:**
- Add the following line inside the condition to capture and store treasure values:
   ```python
   treasure_values.append(value)
   ```
   Right after the line:
   ```python
   if value > 0:
   ```

- Use comments to explain the purpose of each major block of code. For example:
  ```python
  # Traverse through each row and column, count treasures, and store their values.
  ```

- Check the sorting algorithm's impact if larger grids were involved, and explain why the choice is appropriate.

**Conclusion:**
The student code almost achieves the primary objective but misses the key part of collecting and sorting treasure values. With minor adjustments, it can function correctly. The score reflects the incomplete functionality but acknowledges the correct setup and approach.","

",6,"After reevaluation, there's a merit for increasing the score by one point due to the recognition of the existing variables for potentially storing treasure values and the initial setup of the search loop, indicating a conceptual understanding. The original score penalized heavily due to the lack of value storage, which is crucial. However, acknowledging the aspects where the student is on the right path and the presence of appropriately set up variables adds to their learning process:

1. **Correctness of Treasure Identification:** The feedback indicated that correct identification was on the right path, but storage of values was missing. The existing code proves an emerging grasp of counting treasures correctly.

2. **Correctness of Treasure Sorting:** Although no values were stored for sorting, the structure indicates awareness of the need to sort, thus reflecting an incomplete implementation rather than a misunderstanding.

3. **Documentation and Comments:** While comments are absent, the reader can still follow up to a point due to the existing structure, showing an organized workflow.

   Given these observations, an increased score to 6 reflects a balance between acknowledging evident efforts and the required improvements.","

## Problem Statement: Treasure Hunt

### Background:
Welcome to the world of ""Treasure Hunt,"" a game where players search for hidden treasures on a map. The map is a grid consisting of various locations, each of which might contain a treasure. Your task is to assist the treasure hunters by developing an efficient algorithm to locate these treasures using basic searching and sorting techniques.

### Objective:
Design a program that helps identify the location of treasures on a map using searching algorithms. Once the treasures are found, sort them based on their value to help players decide the best treasures to collect.

### Problem Details:

1. **Map Representation:**
   - The map is represented as a two-dimensional grid (list of lists in Python) with dimensions `n x m` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.
   - Each cell in the grid contains an integer value representing either an empty spot (`0`) or a treasure with a certain value (positive integer).

2. **Input:**
   - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the map.
   - The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers, representing the grid. Each integer is either `0` (no treasure) or a positive integer (value of the treasure).

3. **Output:**
   - The first line should output the total number of treasures found on the map.
   - The second line should output the list of treasure values in ascending order.

4. **Algorithm Requirements:**
   - Implement a search algorithm to traverse the grid and locate all the treasures.
   - Use a sorting algorithm to arrange the treasure values in ascending order.
   - The choice of searching and sorting algorithms is up to you, but consider efficiency and clarity.

### Example:

#### Input:

3 4
0 5 0 0
4 0 0 3
0 0 1 0


#### Output:

3
1 3 4 5


### Instructions:

- Write a function `find_and_sort_treasures(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]` that implements the solution.
- Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and flow.
- Consider edge cases, such as maps with no treasures or maps where all cells contain treasures.
- Test your solution with different grid configurations to ensure correctness.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness: The program should accurately identify and sort the treasures.

",7,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

#### Correctness
The student's code does accomplish some of the required tasks but has a slight issue in the sorting mechanism, which affects the output.

- **Treasure Identification:** The student correctly identifies treasures by iterating through each cell in the grid and checking values greater than 0.
  
- **Sorting Order Issue:** The treasures are sorted in descending order (``reverse=True``), whereas the problem requires ascending order.
  
  **Correction Suggestion:**
  
  ```python
  treasures.sort()  # Sort in ascending order by default
  ```

#### Efficiency
The student's approach for traversing and sorting is straightforward and efficient for this grid size constraint (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

#### Code Quality
- **Code Structure & Readability:**
  - The code is well-structured with meaningful variable names (`treasures`) and moderate use of comments. However, there's room for improvement by further clarifying the intent behind using `reverse=True`.
  
- **Documentation:**
  - It's helpful to comment on the sorting choice to ensure clarity, even though the Python `sort()` is efficient.

#### Robustness
- **Edge Cases Handling: **
  - The student has not explicitly handled maps with no treasures or those with all treasure cells. While the code will inherently handle these cases (return [ ]), it's worth mentioning.
  
  **Tip:** Include test cases or notes indicating the expected behavior for these scenarios.

#### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Correct the sorting order** to match the problem requirements.
2. **Enhance Code Comments** to explain each step, especially the sorting choice.
3. **Consider edge cases** to ensure thorough validation of the approach.

#### Final Comments
The student's code is largely correct and functionally goes through the expected operations. Adjustments are necessary primarily in sorting order and explaining the logic through enhanced comments.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Treasure Hunt

### Background:
Welcome to the world of ""Treasure Hunt,"" a game where players search for hidden treasures on a map. The map is a grid consisting of various locations, each of which might contain a treasure. Your task is to assist the treasure hunters by developing an efficient algorithm to locate these treasures using basic searching and sorting techniques.

### Objective:
Design a program that helps identify the location of treasures on a map using searching algorithms. Once the treasures are found, sort them based on their value to help players decide the best treasures to collect.

### Problem Details:

1. **Map Representation:**
   - The map is represented as a two-dimensional grid (list of lists in Python) with dimensions `n x m` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.
   - Each cell in the grid contains an integer value representing either an empty spot (`0`) or a treasure with a certain value (positive integer).

2. **Input:**
   - The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the dimensions of the map.
   - The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers, representing the grid. Each integer is either `0` (no treasure) or a positive integer (value of the treasure).

3. **Output:**
   - The first line should output the total number of treasures found on the map.
   - The second line should output the list of treasure values in ascending order.

4. **Algorithm Requirements:**
   - Implement a search algorithm to traverse the grid and locate all the treasures.
   - Use a sorting algorithm to arrange the treasure values in ascending order.
   - The choice of searching and sorting algorithms is up to you, but consider efficiency and clarity.

### Example:

#### Input:

3 4
0 5 0 0
4 0 0 3
0 0 1 0


#### Output:

3
1 3 4 5


### Instructions:

- Write a function `find_and_sort_treasures(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]` that implements the solution.
- Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and flow.
- Consider edge cases, such as maps with no treasures or maps where all cells contain treasures.
- Test your solution with different grid configurations to ensure correctness.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness: The program should accurately identify and sort the treasures.
- Efficiency: Consider the efficiency of your algorithms, especially with larger maps.
- Code Quality: Code should be organized, with clear variable names and comments.
- Robustness: Handle edge cases gracefully.

"
problem10_statement,problem10-6pt.txt,8,"The student's code is generally correct and meets most of the problem's requirements. Here are some points of evaluation:

### Positives:
1. **Correct Approach:**
   - The student correctly locates all treasures using a double loop to traverse the grid and a condition to check for treasures.
   - The function returns the number of treasures and their sorted values as required.
   
2. **Implementation of Bubble Sort:**
   - The student implemented an in-place bubble sort algorithm to sort the treasures. This is a valid approach, although there are more efficient sorting algorithms available.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The code correctly formats the output for both the number of treasures and their sorted values.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Efficiency:**
   - While the bubble sort works for small lists, it's not the most efficient option for n ≤ 100. Consider using Python's built-in `list.sort()` or `sorted()`, which have average time complexity of O(n log n).

2. **Code Documentation:**
   - Adding comments to explain the sorting logic and function purpose would enhance code readability.

3. **Variable Names:**
   - Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `row`, `col`) instead of `i`, `j` to imply actions akin to the domain problem (e.g., row index and column index).

4. **Edge Case Consideration:**
   - The code works well, but testing with edge cases such as an entirely empty map or a map with just one cell containing a treasure would assure robustness.

### Overall:
The student demonstrates a good understanding of nested loops and sorting algorithms. With some improvements in efficiency and readability, the solution could achieve a perfect score.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",7,"### Evaluation Feedback and Suggestions

#### Correctness:
- **Correctly Identified Treasures:** The student's code accurately identifies treasures in the grid. This is achieved through a nested loop that checks each cell's value in the map.
- **Correct Sorting:** The code uses a bubble sort implementation, which correctly sorts the treasures in ascending order.

#### Efficiency:
- **Efficiency Concern:** The choice of the bubble sort algorithm is less optimal for sorting. With a time complexity of O(n^2), it can become inefficient as the number of treasures increases. Consider using Python's built-in `sort()` method, which is based on Timsort with a time complexity of O(n log n).

#### Code Quality:
- **Variable Naming:** The variable names are self-explanatory (`grid`, `treasures`), which enhances readability.
- **Code Documentation:** The code lacks comments explaining the logic, which can aid in understanding the flow of operations, especially in an educational setting. Adding comments above key sections like the treasure search and sorting algorithms can improve clarity.

#### Robustness:
- **Edge Case Handling:** The student's code handles grids with no treasures (i.e., all zeroes), which is beneficial. However, consider adding test cases for edge cases explicitly in comments or docstrings to ensure computational coverage.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Replace Bubble Sort:**
   - Use Python's built-in `sort()` method for the `treasures` list: `treasures.sort()`. This is more efficient and simplifies the code.

2. **Add Comments:**
   - Provide comments that break down the logic, such as explaining the purpose of the nested loop for searching and providing a short note above the sorting section.

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - While examples are provided in the `__main__`, adding a wider variety of test cases or at least mentioning them can enhance robustness.

Considering the points above, the student's solution is correct but could benefit from improved sorting efficiency and documentation. Therefore, I assign a score of **7 out of 10**.","

**Correctness:**
- The student code correctly implements the function `find_and_sort_treasures` which locates treasures on the grid and sorts their values in ascending order.
- The test case provided in the main block successfully replicates the example scenario from the problem description.

**Efficiency:**
- Utilizes a straightforward traversal of the grid and `sort()` method, both of which are appropriate for the input size constraints. 
- The time complexity is optimal for the given problem constraints (O(n*m) for traversal and O(k log k) for sorting, where k is the number of treasures).

**Code Quality:**
- Code is well-organized and concise with appropriate variable names like `treasure_values` making the code self-explanatory.
- Correct use of Python conventions and libraries such as `List` and `Tuple` from `typing` module.

**Robustness:**
- The method works well for all edge cases: an empty grid (all zeroes) or a grid where all cells are treasures are correctly handled.
- Appropriately outputs the number of treasures and their values, even with default test cases.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Consider adding comments for educational purposes, explaining each part of the code more explicitly to aid understanding for someone learning algorithmic design.
- Extensive testing could further ensure robustness, so incorporating edge cases such as entirely empty grids or grids where every cell contains a treasure might further strengthen confidence in the implementation.

Overall, the student's code is accurate, efficient, and well-written, perfect for the requirements. Excellent job!","

",8,"### Evaluation of the Student Code:

#### Code Overview:
The student has implemented a function `find_and_sort_treasures(grid: List[List[int]])` which correctly traverses a 2D grid to locate treasures and then sorts them. The code is straightforward and uses Python’s built-in list and sort method.

#### Strengths:
1. **Correctness:**
   - The function correctly identifies treasures (values greater than zero) and appends them to a list, which is then sorted and returned with the count of treasures.
   - Expected output results are achieved based on the example input.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - The code is well-organized with clear steps and logical variable names.
   - The function is wrapped with a main block for testing, allowing for simple execution and potential expansion for further test cases.

3. **Efficiency & Simplicity:**
   - This simple approach is efficient given the problem constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Code Comments & Documentation:**
    - The function lacks explanatory comments that outline the purpose of each segment of code. Adding descriptions would improve understanding, especially for learners.

2. **Robustness and Edge Cases:**
   - The student’s implementation doesn’t explicitly handle edge cases like an empty grid. Simple checks before processing would enhance robustness.

3. **Output Format Consistency:**
   - While the student prints results consistent with the problem statement, the format in which sorted treasures are output can be adjusted to use `print(' '.join(map(str, sorted_treasures)))` to align exactly with the example format.

#### Suggestions:
1. **Add Comments:**
    - Provide additional comments to explain the function logic, such as:
      ```python
      # Traverse each row and column in the grid to identify treasures.
      ```

2. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Consider edge cases where the grid might be empty or filled entirely with zeroes. 
     ```python
     if not grid or not grid[0]:
         return 0, []
     ```

3. **Align Output with Problem Statement:**
   - Adjust final output to fully match expected output formats as demonstrated in the model solution.

**Problem Statement: Student Grade Calculator**

**Objective:**

Write a Python program that calculates the final grade for a student in a course. The program should prompt the user to input scores for assignments, quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam. It should then compute the final grade based on the following weight distribution:

- Assignments: 30% 
- Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

**Requirements:**

1. **Input:**
   - The program should prompt the user to enter the following:
     - Five assignment scores (each out of 100).
     - Three quiz scores (each out of 100).
     - One midterm exam score (out of 100).
     - One final exam score (out of 100).

2. **Process:**
   - Calculate the average score for the assignments and quizzes.
   - Compute the weighted contribution of each component (assignments, quizzes, midterm, and final) to the final grade.
   - Sum these weighted contributions to get the final grade.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the computed final grade as a percentage.
   - Provide a letter grade based on the following scale:
     - A: 90% and above
     - B: 80% to 89%
     - C: 70% to 79%
     - D: 60% to 69%
     - F: below 60%

**Constraints:**

- Assume all input scores are valid integers between 0 and 100.
- Use appropriate variable names and comments to make the code readable.
- The program should handle input and output in a user-friendly manner.

**Example:**


Enter your five assignment scores: 85 90 78 92 88
Enter your three quiz scores: 80 85 90
Enter your midterm exam score: 75
Enter your final exam score: 85

Your final grade is: 84.75%
Your letter grade is: B


**Hints:**

   - The student directly sums all scores without calculating the average or applying the specified weights to the assignments, quizzes, midterm, and final exam.

3. **Missing Functions:**
   - The code lacks the use of functions for repetitive tasks such as calculating averages or weighted scores, which is essential for modularity and reusability.

4. **Lack of Logic for Letter Grade:**
   - The student assigns 'A' as a hardcoded letter grade without any logical evaluation of the final percentage, failing to implement the conditional structure to determine the actual letter grade based on calculated final percentage.

5. **Computation of Final Grade:**
   - The final grade calculation does not follow the problem's weighted distribution criteria, leading to incorrect results.

**Suggestions:**
- **Implement Input Handling:** Prompt the user for input to make the program interactive and meet the problem requirements.
- **Calculate Averages and Weights:** Compute the average scores for assignments and quizzes, then apply weights accordingly to derive a meaningful final percentage score.
- **Implement Functions:** Use modular functions such as `calculate_average()` and `determine_letter_grade()` for cleaner structure and to handle repetitive code sections effectively.
- **Correct Final Grade Computation:** Make sure that calculations reflect the weighted contributions of each component to the final grade.

Overall, the student needs to revisit the requirements and adjust their code logic to ensure it meets the objectives of the problem statement. Guidance and practice with structured code logic and modular programming will be beneficial.","

",3,"**Evaluation of Student Code:**

The student code provided is a basic attempt to calculate and display a final grade based on pre-defined scores. Although the outputting components work, the calculations for determining the final percentage and subsequently the letter grade are incorrect and lack essential components. 

### Issues & Suggestions:

1. **Static Input Values:**
   - **Issue:** The student code uses hardcoded input values, which does not meet the requirement of prompting user input.
   - **Suggestion:** Utilize `input()` to receive scores for assignments, quizzes, the midterm, and the final exam from the user, similar to the model solution.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Final Grade:**
   - **Issue:** The code simply sums all the scores without applying the specified weight distribution (Assignments: 30%, Quizzes: 20%, Midterm: 25%, Final: 25%).
   - **Suggestion:**
     - Create a function to calculate the average for assignments and quizzes.
     - Apply the corresponding weights to calculate the final percentage. **Example**:
       - `weighted_assignments = calculate_average(assignment_scores) * 0.30`

3. **Determining the Letter Grade:**
   - **Issue:** The letter grade is hardcoded as 'A'.
   - **Suggestion:** Implement a function to correctly determine the letter grade based on the computed final percentage using conditional statements as provided in the model.

4. **Function Utilization:**
   - **Issue:** The code does not modularize tasks such as calculations and grade determination into separate functions.
   - **Suggestion:** Define and call functions for specific tasks to improve code clarity and maintainability as shown in the model solution e.g., `calculate_average()` and `determine_letter_grade()`.

5. **Commenting and Readability:**
   - **Issue:** The code lacks comments explaining the purpose and logic.
   - **Suggestion:** Add comments to increase readability and help both the writer and others understand the code flow.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:
   - Incorporate user input collection.
   - Properly partition the code into functions.
   - Implement accurate calculations for averages and weighted contributions.
   - Use correct logic for determining the final grade and corresponding letter grade.
   - Enhance code readability through comments and meaningful variable names.
   - Test the code with various inputs to ensure reliability and correctness.

By addressing these improvements, the student can develop a deeper understanding of the problem requirements and write more efficient and functional code in alignment with the problem's specifications. The current score reflects the necessity of these fundamental changes. ","

- Assignments: 30% 
- Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

**Requirements:**

1. **Input:**
   - The program should prompt the user to enter the following:
     - Five assignment scores (each out of 100).
     - Three quiz scores (each out of 100).
     - One midterm exam score (out of 100).
     - One final exam score (out of 100).

2. **Process:**
   - Calculate the average score for the assignments and quizzes.
   - Compute the weighted contribution of each component (assignments, quizzes, midterm, and final) to the final grade.
   - Sum these weighted contributions to get the final grade.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the computed final grade as a percentage.
   - Provide a letter grade based on the following scale:
     - A: 90% and above
     - B: 80% to 89%
     - C: 70% to 79%
     - D: 60% to 69%
     - F: below 60%

**Constraints:**

- Assume all input scores are valid integers between 0 and 100.
- Use appropriate variable names and comments to make the code readable.
- The program should handle input and output in a user-friendly manner.

",2,"After reevaluating the student's code and considering the previously provided feedback and rubric, a reassessment of the score reveals the following:

1. **Input Handling (0 points):** No attempt to handle input from the user was made; scores are hardcoded.
2. **Data Storage (1 point):** Lists are properly used for storing assignment and quiz scores, which is the only rubric criterion fully met.
3. **Average Calculation (0 points):** The code omits any calculation of averages, which is a significant requirement.
4. **Weighted Contribution Calculation (0 points):** No attempt was made to apply the correct weightings to the components.
5. **Final Grade Calculation (0 points):** Simply summing scores entirely ignores the weightings, leading to incorrect results.
6. **Letter Grade Assignment (0 points):** The code fails to process the final percentage correctly yet assigns a grade, rendering this feature inaccurate.
7. **Output Formatting (0.5 points):** Although the output exists, it misrepresents the student's achievements due to flawed calculations.
8. **Code Readability and Comments (0 points):** The absence of comments hinders understanding of the code's intentions.
9. **Use of Functions (0 points):** The student didn't use functions to tackle repetitive tasks or calculations, missing an opportunity for code modularization and clarity.
10. **Error Handling and Assumptions (0.5 points):** Hardcoded scores are within valid ranges but this point is moot given the lack of user input.

Given these deficiencies, the student's previous score of 3 seems somewhat generous. Based on the comprehensive nature of the rubric and the weaknesses evident in the code, a score adjustment to 2 is appropriate to account for the understanding of data storage through lists. For future improvements, emphasis should be on dynamically handling user input and properly implementing the calculation and processing logic. This will build foundational knowledge and engagement with programming concepts reflective of their significance in the problem statement.","

"
problem1_statement,problem1-2pt.txt,6,"The student's code demonstrates some understanding of input handling and basic operations, but there are several areas that need improvement:

1. **Inconsistent Weight Calculation:**
   - The final grade calculation uses multipliers (30, 20, 25, 25) instead of weights in decimal form (0.30, 0.20, 0.25, 0.25). This results in the final grade being incorrectly calculated as it's not a percentage of 100 anymore.

2. **Lack of Reusability and Efficiency:**
   - The solution employs individual variables for assignments and quizzes rather than using lists, making the code less extendable and repetitive.
   - Functions could be introduced to calculate average and letter grades for better modularity and reuse.

3. **Non-inclusion of Letter Grade Determination:**
   - The student's code does not include a mechanism to determine and print the letter grade, which was an essential requirement.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output for the final grade does not align with specified formatting (i.e., showing percentage with two decimal places) and is missing the output of the associated letter grade.

### Recommendations:
- **Employ List Usage:**
  - Utilize lists to store assignment and quiz scores to streamline the code, facilitating simple calculations like the sum and average.

- **Use Functions:**
  - Develop separate functions for computing averages and determining letter grades to enhance code clarity and flexibility.

- **Correct Weight Application:**
  - Use decimal weights instead of whole numbers when calculating final grade contributions, ensuring the output represents a valid percentage.

- **Implement Full Requirements:**
  - Add logic to determine and print the letter grade based on the computed final percentage, aligning with the problem's requirements.

By addressing these issues, the student can greatly enhance the code's accuracy, readability, and adherence to the problem requirements.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"Here is a detailed evaluation and suggestions for improvement based on your code implementation:

### Observations:
1. **Variable Repetitiveness:**
   - You have defined variables `assignment1` to `assignment5` and `quiz1` to `quiz3`. Using lists to store scores could streamline your input process.

2. **Calculation of Weighted Averages:**
   - The weights for computing the final grade should be within 0 to 1, representing percentages.
   - You have multiplied assignment and quiz scores by 30 and 20 directly instead of their respective weights (0.30 and 0.20).

3. **Lack of Functions:**
   - The implementation is not modular. Functions should be used for repetitive tasks like calculating averages, computing weighted scores, and determining letter grades.

4. **Letter Grade Omission:**
   - The program does not determine and output the letter grade based on the calculated percentage.

5. **Feedback to User:**
   - Including formatted output to show the percentage with two decimal places would make the readout more precise.


### Suggestions:
1. **Use Lists for Scores:**
   - Store assignment and quiz scores in lists to handle repetitive inputs efficiently.
   ```python
   assignment_scores = [int(input()) for _ in range(5)]
   quiz_scores = [int(input()) for _ in range(3)]
   ```

2. **Implement Functions:**
   - Define and use functions to encapsulate repeated logic, such as:
   ```python
   def calculate_average(scores):
       return sum(scores) / len(scores)
   ```

3. **Correct Weighted Calculations:**
   - Ensure you multiply by the correct decimal representation for weights:
   ```python
   weighted_assignments = average_assignments * 0.30
   weighted_quizzes = average_quizzes * 0.20
   ````

4. **Determine and Display Letter Grade:**
   - Implement logic to assign and print a letter grade:
   ```python
   def determine_letter_grade(percentage):
       if percentage >= 90:
           return 'A'
       elif percentage >= 80:
           return 'B'
       elif percentage >= 70:
           return 'C'
       elif percentage >= 60:
           return 'D'
       else:
           return 'F'
   ```

5. **Enhanced Feedback:**
   - Format grade output to maintain precision:
   ```python
   print(f""Your final grade is: {final_grade:.2f}%"")
   ```
 
### Conclusion:
By incorporating these improvements, your code will become more modular, efficient, and user-friendly, aligning with best practices for writing maintainable code. Keep up the good effort and apply these suggestions to enhance your understanding further!","

**Problem Statement: Student Grade Calculator**

**Objective:**

Write a Python program that calculates the final grade for a student in a course. The program should prompt the user to input scores for assignments, quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam. It should then compute the final grade based on the following weight distribution:

- Assignments: 30% 
- Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

**Requirements:**

1. **Input:**
   - The program should prompt the user to enter the following:
     - Five assignment scores (each out of 100).
     - Three quiz scores (each out of 100).
     - One midterm exam score (out of 100).
     - One final exam score (out of 100).

2. **Process:**
   - Calculate the average score for the assignments and quizzes.
   - Compute the weighted contribution of each component (assignments, quizzes, midterm, and final) to the final grade.
   - Sum these weighted contributions to get the final grade.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the computed final grade as a percentage.
   - Provide a letter grade based on the following scale:
     - A: 90% and above
     - B: 80% to 89%
     - C: 70% to 79%
     - D: 60% to 69%
     - F: below 60%

**Constraints:**

- Assume all input scores are valid integers between 0 and 100.
- Use appropriate variable names and comments to make the code readable.
- The program should handle input and output in a user-friendly manner.

**Example:**


Enter your five assignment scores: 85 90 78 92 88
Enter your three quiz scores: 80 85 90
Enter your midterm exam score: 75
Enter your final exam score: 85

Your final grade is: 84.75%
Your letter grade is: B


**Hints:**

- Use lists to store multiple scores for assignments and quizzes.
- Use the `sum()` function to calculate the total score for assignments and quizzes.
- Remember to convert integer scores to floats when calculating averages to ensure accurate division.
- Consider defining functions for repetitive tasks such as calculating averages or weighted scores.

",7,"### Evaluation of the Student's Code:

**Functionality and Structure:**
- The student's code accurately prompts for input, calculates average scores for assignments and quizzes, and computes the final weighted grade. 
- Output is presented cleanly and informatively to the user.

**Suggestions for Improvements:**

1. **Code Reusability:**
   - Introduce a function to calculate averages. This promotes code reuse and clarity.
     ```python
     def calculate_average(scores):
         return sum(scores) / len(scores)
     ```
   - Use this function for both `average_assignments` and `average_quizzes`.

2. **Letter Grade Calculation:**
   - The program should also determine and print the letter grade based on the final percentage. The addition of a `determine_letter_grade` function can manage this.
     ```python
     def determine_letter_grade(percentage):
         if percentage >= 90:
             return 'A'
         elif percentage >= 80:
             return 'B'
         elif percentage >= 70:
             return 'C'
         elif percentage >= 60:
             return 'D'
         else:
             return 'F'
     ```
   - Incorporate this logic into the `main` function and print the letter grade.

3. **Structure & Readability:**
   - Adding comments on blocks of code helps improve readability, ensuring each main functional part is easy to follow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The solution adheres well to the input-output requirements: it assumes correct input format and valid integer scores, correctly calculates weighted scores, and presents the numeric final grade.

By introducing functions for repetitive tasks and inclusive grading logic, the code can become more elegant and comprehensive. These changes enhance maintainability without deviating from the problem constraints and structure. Overall, a solid attempt that can be improved with these few adjustments.","

",7,"The student’s code demonstrates a mostly functional approach to solving the problem, but there are some key areas that could be improved upon, in line with the more detailed rubric: 

1. **Input Handling (1/1):**
   - The student correctly prompts the user to input all necessary scores for assignments, quizzes, the midterm, and the final exam.

2. **Data Storage (1/1):**
   - The use of lists for storing assignment and quiz scores is effectively implemented.

3. **Average Calculation (1/1):**
   - Averages for assignments and quizzes are correctly calculated using the `sum()` function along with appropriate division.

4. **Weighted Contribution Calculation (2/2):**
   - The student accurately computes the weighted contributions for all components (assignments, quizzes, midterm, final exam) based on the provided weights.

5. **Final Grade Calculation (1/1):**
   - Correct summation of weighted contributions results in an accurate final grade percentage.

6. **Letter Grade Assignment (0/1):**
   - The current code does not include a separate function to determine or display the letter grade. This is a significant omission from the problem's requirements.

7. **Output Formatting (0.5/1):**
   - While the final percentage grade is displayed correctly, the absence of a letter grade reduces the clarity and completeness of the output.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (0/1):**
   - The code lacks comments and more descriptive variable names which would improve readability and understanding.

9. **Use of Functions (0/1):**
   - The solution does not leverage functions to encapsulate repetitive tasks, such as those for calculating averages or determining letter grades. 

10. **Error Handling and Assumptions (0.5/1):**
    - Assumes valid input as per constraints but doesn't demonstrate any visible error handling for unexpected inputs or additional comments on input expectations.

**Overall Suggestion:** To improve, the student should include a function for letter grade determination, incorporate proper comments, make use of more appropriate functions for tasks such as average calculation and possibly restructure the code for improved readability. Error handling or clear assumptions in comments should also be considered.","

This rubric ensures that students are evaluated on both the correctness and quality of their code, encouraging good programming practices and clear communication of their solutions.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",6,"Upon reevaluation, the student's code meets several technical requirements such as input handling, data storage, and weighted contribution calculation. They correctly calculate averages and sum weighted contributions, receiving full points in those rubric categories (6 points out of a possible 7 from these criteria alone).

However, the student missed implementing a function to determine and display letter grades, which is a core requirement of the task — this omission results in a deduction in both 'Letter Grade Assignment' and 'Output Formatting' criteria (loss of 1.5 points here).

The rubric also emphasizes good programming practices, including function usage for repetitive tasks and code readability through comments, none of which were adequately addressed in the student's submission. Although the previous feedback suggested including functions and improving code readability, the lack of modifications in these areas is significant (resulting in a deduction of 1.5 points).

Additionally, the absence of comments or any error-handling strategy further contributes to a less-than-optimal solution, which previously was partially penalized (0.5 point deduction).

In considering all factors — especially the lack of addressing feedback on key areas of letter grade determination and code structure improvements — a slight decrease in the score from 7 to 6 is justified, reflecting the need for more comprehensive adherence to programming best practices.","

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Fix the Weight Distribution:**
   - Update `weighted_assignments` and `weighted_quizzes` to calculate respectively using 0.30 and 0.20 factors:
     ```python
     weighted_assignments = average_assignments * 0.30
     weighted_quizzes = average_quizzes * 0.20
     ```

2. **Implement Letter Grade Calculation:**
   - Introduce the `determine_letter_grade` function and call it to find the letter grade. This functionality is crucial for giving a complete solution.
     ```python
     def determine_letter_grade(percentage):
         # Determine letter grade based on percentage
     letter_grade = determine_letter_grade(final_percentage)
     print(f""Your letter grade is: {letter_grade}"")
     ```

3. **Include Error Handling:**
   - Utilize `try` and `except` blocks to catch invalid inputs and guide the user back to correct input prompts.

**Problem Statement: Student Grade Calculator**

**Objective:**

Write a Python program that calculates the final grade for a student in a course. The program should prompt the user to input scores for assignments, quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam. It should then compute the final grade based on the following weight distribution:

- Assignments: 30% 
- Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

**Requirements:**

1. **Input:**
   - The program should prompt the user to enter the following:
     - Five assignment scores (each out of 100).
     - Three quiz scores (each out of 100).
     - One midterm exam score (out of 100).
     - One final exam score (out of 100).

2. **Process:**
   - Calculate the average score for the assignments and quizzes.
   - Compute the weighted contribution of each component (assignments, quizzes, midterm, and final) to the final grade.
   - Sum these weighted contributions to get the final grade.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the computed final grade as a percentage.
   - Provide a letter grade based on the following scale:
     - A: 90% and above
     - B: 80% to 89%
     - C: 70% to 79%
     - D: 60% to 69%
     - F: below 60%

**Constraints:**

- Assume all input scores are valid integers between 0 and 100.
- Use appropriate variable names and comments to make the code readable.
- The program should handle input and output in a user-friendly manner.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!


### Submission

1. **Code File**: Submit the source code file(s) for your program.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Previous Score: 10

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
"
problem2_statement,problem2-0pt.txt,3,"**Feedback on Student's Code:**

1. **Correctness:**
   - The student's code lacks the necessary functionality to correctly perform arithmetic operations, as the `calc` function is incorrectly defined. In Python, using `op` directly within the expression doesn't concatenate operators for arithmetic processes.

2. **Syntax and Semantics:**
   - The function `calc` is defined with the parameters `x, y, op`, but Python does not support direct string-based operations in this manner without additional handling of the operator.
   - Correct use of function definition and input statements is present, but variable parsing is missing for number calculations.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - The structure is too minimal and lacks implementation details needed for fully functional code.
   - Missing core components such as conditionals to handle different operations, and desired encapsulation of operations into functions.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Basic prompt exists to welcome users and collect inputs, but lacks robustness as inputs are not properly converted to numeric types.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - No error handling is present for invalid input or for division by zero cases.

6. **Feedback Summary:**
   - The submitted code needs significant work to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Enhancements should include converting input strings to numbers, properly evaluating the operation requested by the user, comprehensive error handling, and using helper functions for calculations. Improvements in these areas will align the solution more closely to the model example and ensure accurate execution of operations.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",3,"### Evaluation of Student's Code:

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `calc` function is incorrectly attempting to use `op` as an operator in `x op y`. Python does not parse `op` as an operator within expressions.
   - It currently lacks conditional logic to interpret the `op` string (+, -, *, /).

2. **Data Types**:
   - The variable `num1` and `num2` are obtained as strings from `input()` function but not converted to numeric types. This can lead to incorrect arithmetic operations or errors.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - There is no handling for division by zero or invalid operator inputs.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The program does not allow repeated calculations without restarting, which could be enhanced via a loop.

5. **Function Use**:
   - Although functions were not explicitly required, separating arithmetic logic into helper functions would improve code clarity and reusability.

#### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Correct Function Implementation**:
   - Implement control structures (if-else) to handle arithmetic based on `op` value.

```python
 def calc(x, y, op):
     if op == '+':
         return x + y
     elif op == '-':
         return x - y
     elif op == '*':
         return x * y
     elif op == '/':
         return x / y if y != 0 else ""Error: Division by zero""
     else:
         return ""Error: Invalid Operator""
```

2. **Convert Input to Numeric Types**:
   - Convert `num1` and `num2` to floats after user input to ensure correct arithmetic operations.

```python
    num1 = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
    num2 = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))
```

3. **Add Loop for Repeated Calculations**:
   - Implement a loop allowing users to perform multiple calculations with the option to exit.

```python
    while True:
        ... # Code for calculation
        another_calculation = input(""Perform another calculation? (yes/no): "")
        if another_calculation.lower() != 'yes':
            break
```

4. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add error checks for incorrect operators and division by zero within the logic part.

### Overall Score: 3/10
Overall, the student's code has significant issues preventing it from running successfully according to the program specifications. The function logic is incomplete and there is a lack of error handling and user interface improvements. However, the effort in foundational setup is appreciated, hence the score of 3.

",3,"### Evaluation of Student Code

1. **Correctness of Arithmetic Operations (0/2 points):**
   - The student's `calc()` function attempts to perform arithmetic operations using a syntax (`x op y`) that is invalid in Python. It does not specify which arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform, resulting in incorrect execution of all operations.

2. **Syntax and Semantics (1/2 points):**
   - The code is mostly syntactically correct in terms of Python syntax for defining functions and input, but there is a misunderstanding of how to properly execute dynamic operations. The use of `op` inside `calc()` is invalid.

3. **Use of Variables and Data Types (0/1 points):**
   - The program uses variables to store input, but it does not handle data types correctly, as user input is stored as strings instead of being converted to numerical types.

4. **User Input Handling (1/1 points):**
   - The code prompts for user inputs correctly for the numbers and the operator.

5. **Conditional Statements (0/1 points):**
   - There are no conditional statements to decide which operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to execute based on user input.

6. **Loop Implementation (0/1 points):**
   - No loop is implemented to allow the user to perform multiple calculations.

7. **Function Implementation (0/1 points):**
   - A single function `calc()` is defined but it isn't implemented correctly for all arithmetic operations needed.

8. **Error Handling (0/1 points):**
   - No error handling is present for division by zero or invalid operator inputs.

9. **User Interaction and Output (1/1 points):**
   - The program outputs a result using a basic print statement, but it does not inform users of any operational errors. However, prompts are clear.

10. **Code Structure and Documentation (0/1 points):**
    - The code lacks comments or documentation explaining the logic, particularly regarding the handling of arithmetic operations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Correct Function logic:** Instead of using `x op y`, adopt conditional statements or a dictionary mapping operators to functions.
- **Data Types:** Convert user input from strings to numeric types using `int()` or `float()`.
- **Error Handling:** Consider using try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs and division by zero.
- **Looping for Continuous Operations:** Implement a loop to allow repeated calculations.
- **Documentation:** Add comments explaining each section and the purpose of code blocks.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10

",3,"The student's code was previously evaluated and given a score of 3/10. The breakdown was based on the rubric which aligns with the learning objectives. Here's a reevaluation considering the provided feedback:

1. **Correctness of Arithmetic Operations (0/2 points):** The student failed to implement basic arithmetic operation functionality, as the use of 'x op y' is invalid in Python. This issue was flagged in the original feedback and was not addressed.

2. **Syntax and Semantics (1/2 points):** Despite a misunderstanding of dynamic operation execution, the student managed to adhere to Python's function and input syntax, thus partially fulfilling this category. The previous score remained accurate.

3. **Use of Variables and Data Types (0/1 points):** Data types were not handled, as input conversion from string to number was missing, an issue well-identified in the initial review.

4. **User Input Handling (1/1 points):** Correctly prompting and gathering user input were accomplished, meriting full points.

5. **Conditional Statements (0/1 points):** Without any conditional logic, the program cannot decide on operations based on inputs. This shortfall persists in the reevaluation.

6. **Loop Implementation (0/1 points):** The absence of any looping functionality stood undisputed and matches the prior review's evaluation.

7. **Function Implementation (0/1 points):** The lack of separate, operation-specific functions still exists; hence, the prior score is justified.

8. **Error Handling (0/1 points):** No mechanisms were in place to manage errors like division by zero or invalid input, maintaining consistency with earlier feedback.

9. **User Interaction and Output (1/1 points):** Clear prompts and a basic result output were present, deserving full points in both reviews.

10. **Code Structure and Documentation (0/1 points):** The absence of any explanatory comments or documentation continues to be evident, maintaining the original score.

Given the provided feedback and rubric factors, the previous score of 3 remains justified. The student must address the crucial aspects outlined to fully meet the problem requirements. Thus, the score should remain unchanged.","

#### Strengths:
- **Correctness and Clarity:** The student code successfully performs arithmetic operations based on user input, which aligns well with the primary goal of the task.
- **Syntax and Semantics:** The use of functions and conditional statements is consistent with Python syntax and semantics, demonstrating an understanding of the language's basic constructs.
- **Code Structure:** The code is well-organized, with separate functions for each arithmetic operation, enhancing clarity and reusability.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling for exceptions such as division by zero and invalid user input types. Including safeguards for these potential errors could prevent runtime crashes and provide a more robust user experience.
- **User Interaction & Loop:** The program won't handle continuous calculations because there's no loop to repeatedly prompt the user. Implementing a loop will align better with the task requirements and provide a more practical user experience.
- **Data Types:** Using `int` data type limits precision in division operations and restricts calculations to integers. Switching to `float` would allow for better handling of fractional numbers and division.

#### Suggestions:
- **Implement a Loop:** Incorporate a loop to enable repeated calculations until the user decides to exit, enhancing practicality and user engagement.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Add checks for division by zero within the `divide` function and handle invalid inputs for both numbers and operators.
- **Enhance Input Flexibility:** Consider changing input data types to `float` to allow for both integer and decimal calculations, providing broader operational scope.

With these enhancements, the student's code could achieve greater robustness, usability, and alignment with project specifications.","

",6,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

The student's code successfully utilizes functions for the four basic arithmetic operations, employs conditional statements to select operations based on user input, and uses basic user interaction and input handling. However, there are several areas for improvement:

**Corrections and Suggestions:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - **Numeric Input Conversion:**
     - Change numeric input conversion from `int` to `float` to handle decimal numbers, which increases versatility.
     - Suggested Change:  
       ```python
       num1 = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
       num2 = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))
       ```
   
2. **Error Handling:**
   - **Division by Zero:**
     - The current code does not handle division by zero, which can cause the program to crash. Implement a check in the `divide` function.
     - Suggested Change:  
       ```python
       def divide(x, y):
           if y == 0:
               return ""Error: Division by zero is not allowed.""
           return x / y
       ```
   - **Invalid Operator Feedback:**
     - Add feedback for invalid operator input before attempting to print the result.
     - Suggested Change:
       ```python
       if operator == '+':
           result = add(num1, num2)
       elif operator == '-':
           result = subtract(num1, num2)
       elif operator == '*':
           result = multiply(num1, num2)
       elif operator == '/':
           result = divide(num1, num2)
       else:
           print(""Invalid operator. Please choose from +, -, *, /."")
           return
       print(""Result:"", result)
       ```

3. **Loop for Multiple Calculations:**
   - Allow users to perform another calculation without restarting the program using a loop.
   - Suggested Implementation: Encapsulate the main logic inside a `while` loop and ask the user if they wish to perform another calculation.

4. **User Interaction and Experience:**
   - Add user-friendly statements explaining the calculation process and thanks message for using the program.
   - Suggested Statements: 
     ```python
     print(""Welcome to the Simple Calculator!"")
    
     while True:
         # Existing code ...
         another_calculation = input(""Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): "").lower()
         if another_calculation != 'yes':
             break
     print(""Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!"")
     ```

### Summary
- **Score:** 6/10
- Fundamentals of function usage and basic control structures are well-understood, but improvements are needed in error handling, flexible input handling, and enhanced user experience.
- Implementing the above suggestions will improve code robustness, usability, and user interaction.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!


### Submission

1. **Code File**: Submit the source code file(s) for your program.
2. **Documentation**: Provide a short document explaining the syntax and semantics of the constructs you used, along with any challenges faced during implementation and how you resolved them.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness: The program should correctly perform the arithmetic operations based on user input.
- Syntax and Semantics: Proper use of syntax and understanding of semantics in the chosen language.
- Code Structure: Clarity, organization, and use of basic constructs.
- User Interaction: User-friendly prompts and outputs.

5. **Conditional Statements (1 point):**
   - **1 point awarded:** Clear and correct use of if-elif statements based on user input.

6. **Loop Implementation (optional) (1 point):**
   - **0 points awarded:** Absence of a loop for iterative calculations suggests missed enhancements in user convenience.

7. **Function Implementation (optional) (1 point):**
   - **1 point awarded:** Functions are used effectively to separate arithmetic logic, aligning with modular programming practices.

8. **Error Handling (1 point):**
   - **0 points awarded:** Lacks essential error handling for division by zero and selectors, impacting user experience negatively.

9. **User Interaction and Output (1 point):**
   - **0 points awarded:** The program provides basic user interaction with minimal output feedback; enhancement needed for clarity and helpfulness.

10. **Code Structure and Documentation (1 point):**
    - **0 points awarded:** Absence of comments or documentation fails to support readability or educational engagement.

---

The absence of loops, no improvement in user-friendly interaction, and lack of error handling justifies reducing the initial score from 7 to **6**. While the student meets essential functionalities, opportunities for enhanced learning based on coding practices in user interaction and error handling were missed, which were key learning objectives.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!


### Submission

1. **Code File**: Submit the source code file(s) for your program.
2. **Documentation**: Provide a short document explaining the syntax and semantics of the constructs you used, along with any challenges faced during implementation and how you resolved them.

### Evaluation Criteria

",8,"Overall, the student's implementation effectively fulfills the task requirements by correctly handling arithmetic operations and managing basic errors. However, there are some areas for improvement:

### **Assessment and Recommendations:**

1. **Functional Decomposition into Functions:**
   - **Current Implementation:**
     - Direct arithmetic operations are conducted within the main loop.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Separate each arithmetic operation into distinct functions (e.g., `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`). This not only aligns with best practices for code maintainability and readability but also makes debugging and testing easier.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - **Current Implementation:**
     - The program correctly handles division by zero and invalid input scenarios.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Consider moving the division error handling logic into a `divide()` function, allowing centralized error control and aligning with the modular design of the code.

3. **Consistency and User Feedback:**
   - **Current Implementation:**
     - The program directly prints results and error messages, which functionally eats into clarity.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Ensure that the feedback is consistent and that the results are formatted neatly with more detailed explanations when errors arise. For instance, ""Invalid operator. Please select among +, -, *, / and try again."" This ensures all errors are well guided for user understanding.

4. **Code Comments and Documentation:**
   - **Current Implementation:**
     - Missing in-line comments explaining the purpose of sections in the code.
   - **Recommendation:**
     - Add comments to enhance the clarity and purpose of key segments, especially regarding error handling and control flow.

5. **Optional Features:**
   - **Loops & Functionality: (Optional for improvement)**
     - Consider adding more nuanced functions for validating inputs or an exit feature that advises the user before breaking out of the loop.

### **Conclusion:**
The student's code is functional and meets the core requirements, though incorporating suggested enhancements will not only help instill better programming practices but also boost clarity and future expandability. The overall score reflects the solid performance yet acknowledges room for improvement and optimization in design and structure.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",7,"**Evaluation of the Student's Code**

The student's implementation largely adheres to the problem requirements but misses out on some key aspects for robustness and interaction. 

**Positives:**
1. **Correctness**: 
   - The core logic for mathematical operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - is implemented and appears functional provided correct user input.
   - Clearly segregated functions for each operation demonstrate understanding of modular programming.

2. **Syntax and Semantics**:
   - The code is written using proper syntax highlighting understanding of Python’s constructs.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - The organization is clear, with the `main()` function serving as the entry point.
   - Use of try-except demonstrates an understanding of basic error handling.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Error Handling and Validation**: 
   - **Division by Zero**: The 'divide' function does not handle division by zero, which leads to a runtime error if tried.
     - **Suggestion**: Within the `divide` function, check if the divisor (`y`) is zero and return an error message if so.
   - **Post-Functional Error Handling**: Currently, the code checks for invalid inputs and operators but quits after printing the error message. The program should loop back to allow the user another attempt.
     - **Suggestion**: Introduce a loop to prompt the user again in case of invalid inputs.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - **Continuous Operations**: The problem encourages a loop to let users perform multiple calculations. Currently, the code exits after one operation.
     - **Suggestion**: Implement a loop in the `main()` function so that users can perform new calculations and terminate when they choose.

3. **Code Documentation**:
   - Encouraged to add comments to explain complex parts of the code which aids in maintainability and understandability.

**Additional Considerations for Improvement:**
- Emphasizing line spacing between functions and logical blocks for better readability.
- Use functions to handle user inputs separately for better modularity.
- Consider further error handling strategies such as securing against non-numeric input when only a number is expected.

By addressing the suggested improvements, the robustness of the code will significantly increase, enhancing its functionality and user friendliness.","

Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

   - Consider adding a loop to allow continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.

7. **Function Implementation (Optional) (1/1)**:
   - Separate functions are defined for each arithmetic operation, which is a good practice for code modularity and reusability.

8. **Error Handling (0/1)**:
   - The code lacks error handling for division by zero, which would cause the program to crash if attempted.
   - Incorporate error handling to manage division by zero and provide user feedback in such cases.

9. **User Interaction and Output (1/1)**:
   - User prompts and outputs are clear and straightforward, enhancing the user experience.

10. **Code Structure and Documentation (0/1)**:

4. **User Input Handling (1/1):** User inputs are handled well, ensuring accurate reading of numbers and operators.

5. **Conditional Statements (1/1):** Correctly implemented if-else statements determine the operations.

6. **Loop Implementation (0/1):** A loop wasn't implemented, affecting usability slightly as users can't perform consecutive calculations in one go. Yet, this was an optional extra credit.

7. **Function Implementation (1/1):** The student implemented functions well, aligning with the rubric's expectations for optional tasks.

8. **Error Handling (0/1):** The program does not address division by zero, which is vital for program robustness.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",8,"### Evaluation of Student Code:

The student code largely follows the problem requirements and successfully implements a simple calculator in Python. Here are the specific areas of assessment based on criteria:

#### Correctness:
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Correctly implements all four arithmetic operations using functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`).
- **Loop:** Correctly uses an indefinite `while` loop to keep the program running until the user chooses ""no"".
- **Error on Division by Zero:** While the program checks for division operation, there's no handling for division by zero in the `divide` function. This could lead to a runtime error when attempting to divide by zero.

#### Syntax and Semantics:
- **Syntax and Semantics:** Correct usage of Python constructs, such as function definitions, loops, conditionals, and exception handling.

#### Code Structure:
- **Code Organization:** The code is neatly structured into functions, promoting readability and modularity.
- **Maintainability:** Good separation of concerns by isolating operations into functions.

#### User Interaction:
- **User Prompts:** Provides clear instructions for user input. User feedback on errors (like wrong operators) is appropriately handled.

#### Error Handling:
- **Division by Zero Error:** While there's prompt error handling for invalid inputs, division by zero hasn't been managed.
- **Suggested Code Fix:** Modify the `divide` function to handle division by zero:
  ```python
  def divide(x, y):
      if y == 0:
          return ""Error: Division by zero is not allowed.""
      else:
          return x / y
  ```

### Recommendations for Improvement:
1. **Division by Zero:** Implement error handling in the `divide` function to check for division by zero.
2. **Additional Feedback:** Encouraging students to use more user feedback, such as a succinct list of valid operators when an invalid operator is entered.
3. **Loop Exit Condition:** Consider revising the loop exit condition to handle both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ inputs uniformly, providing an explicit condition for exit.

### Overall Performance:
The student's implementation demonstrates a strong grasp of Python programming basics, with a minor need for error checking improvements. The score reflects these strengths and indicates a high degree of functionality, given their understanding of syntax and semantics.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Understanding Syntax, Semantics, and Basic Constructs

### Background

As an introduction to programming languages, understanding syntax, semantics, and basic constructs is fundamental. Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered valid in a programming language. Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the meaning of these syntactical elements and how they produce effects during execution. Basic constructs are the building blocks of programming, such as variables, control structures, data types, and functions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the syntax and semantics of a chosen programming language (Python, Java, or C++).
2. Implement basic constructs including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and simple functions.
3. Write, compile (if necessary), and execute a simple program that demonstrates these concepts.

### Task

You are required to write a simple program in **one** of the following programming languages: Python, Java, or C++. Your program should simulate a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should follow the specific syntax and semantics of the chosen language and utilize basic constructs appropriately.

#### Requirements

1. **Variables and Data Types:**
   - Declare variables to store user input and the results of arithmetic operations.
   - Use appropriate data types for storing numerical values (e.g., `int`, `float`, or `double`).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Use if-else or switch-case (in Java/C++) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's input.

4. **Loops (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. The loop should terminate when the user chooses to exit.

5. **Functions (optional but encouraged for extra practice):**
   - Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Include basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid operator inputs.

7. **Output:**
   - Display the result of the arithmetic operation in a user-friendly manner.

#### Example Interaction


Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 * 5 = 50

Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!


### Submission

1. **Code File**: Submit the source code file(s) for your program.
2. **Documentation**: Provide a short document explaining the syntax and semantics of the constructs you used, along with any challenges faced during implementation and how you resolved them.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness: The program should correctly perform the arithmetic operations based on user input.
- Syntax and Semantics: Proper use of syntax and understanding of semantics in the chosen language.
- Code Structure: Clarity, organization, and use of basic constructs.
- User Interaction: User-friendly prompts and outputs.
- Error Handling: Appropriately managing potential errors such as division by zero and invalid input.

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are developing a simple program for a small retail store to manage inventory and sales. The program needs to keep track of the following information for a single product:

1. **Product Name:** The name of the product (e.g., ""Wireless Mouse"").
2. **Product Price:** The price of the product (e.g., 25.99).
3. **Product Quantity:** The quantity of the product available in stock (e.g., 50).
4. **Product On Sale:** A boolean indicating whether the product is currently on sale (e.g., True or False).

Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Declare Variables:**
   - Declare a variable for each of the four pieces of information mentioned above and initialize them with appropriate values.

2. **Display Product Information:**
   - Print the product information in a user-friendly format. For example:
     
     Product Name: Wireless Mouse
     Product Price: $25.99
     Product Quantity: 50
     Product On Sale: Yes
     

3. **Calculate Total Value of Inventory:**
   - Calculate the total value of the inventory for this product (i.e., Product Price * Product Quantity) and store it in a variable. Print this value with a descriptive message.

4. **Update Inventory:**
   - Simulate a sale where 5 units of the product are sold. Update the product quantity accordingly and print the new quantity.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - Write a conditional statement to check if the product is on sale. If it is, print a message indicating that customers can enjoy a discount. If not, print a message that the product is sold at regular price.

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate data types for each variable.
- Ensure the output is well-formatted and easy to read.
- Use comments in your code to describe each step and the purpose of your variables.
- Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

**Additional Challenge (Optional):**

- Modify your program to allow the user to input the product information instead of hardcoding the values. Use the `input()` function to gather data from the user.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit your Python script file named `inventory_manager.py`.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and meets all the requirements stated above.

By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of how variables and different data types are used in programming, setting the stage for more complex operations and data manipulations.

problem3_statement,problem3-0pt.txt,2,"**Evaluation of the Student Code:**

1. **Declaring Variables:  
   -** Product name, price, and quantity are not properly using data types. The name should be a string, price a float, and quantity an integer.
   - Product on sale should be a Boolean, not a string.

2. **Displaying Product Information:**
   - Print statements are not formatted correctly. Concatenating using `+` without converting to strings can lead to errors.
   
3. **Calculating Total Inventory Value:**
   - Attempted multiplication directly on string types for price and quantity results in a type error. Correct data types should be used with formatted output.

4. **Updating Inventory:**
   - The operation of subtracting a string ('5') from another string value (the quantity) is incorrect. Both should be integer data types to perform arithmetic operations.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - The if condition is checking a non-Boolean string value that doesn't reflect the intended purpose.

6. **Additional Requirements:**
   - There are no comments describing the code's purpose and flow, resulting in reduced readability.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Ensure data types align with their purpose (e.g., integers, floats, booleans). For example, `product_price` should be a float.
- Use string formatting (such as `format()` or f-strings) to manage and present strings and numbers more precisely.
- Implement error handling for user input to ensure correct data types are entered.
- Add comments to guide readers through the thought process and logic behind each operation.","

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are developing a simple program for a small retail store to manage inventory and sales. The program needs to keep track of the following information for a single product:

1. **Product Name:** The name of the product (e.g., ""Wireless Mouse"").
2. **Product Price:** The price of the product (e.g., 25.99).
3. **Product Quantity:** The quantity of the product available in stock (e.g., 50).
4. **Product On Sale:** A boolean indicating whether the product is currently on sale (e.g., True or False).

Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Declare Variables:**
   - Declare a variable for each of the four pieces of information mentioned above and initialize them with appropriate values.

",3,"### Evaluation Result

Upon reviewing your code, I see you have made a good start by declaring and assigning values to the variables. However, several issues need addressing to achieve the desired functionality as outlined in the problem description. Below, I've provided feedback based on your implementation:

### Issues and Suggestions:

1. **Data Type Mismatches:**
    - ***Product Name:*** 
      - **Current:** `product_name = 123`
      - **Suggested:** Use a string to store the product name, e.g., `product_name = ""Wireless Mouse""`.
    - ***Product Price:*** 
      - **Current:** `product_price = ""25.99""`
      - **Suggested:** `product_price = 25.99` should be a float to allow for mathematical operations.
      
    - ***Product Quantity:*** 
      - **Current:**  `product_quantity = ""fifty""`
      - **Suggested:** `product_quantity = 50` should be an integer for quantity tracking.

    - ***Product On Sale:*** 
      - **Current:** `product_on_sale = ""False""`
      - **Suggested:** Use a Boolean type, e.g., `product_on_sale = False`.

2. **Concatenation and Output Formatting:**
    - **Problem:** Concatenation with `print` may cause errors due to mismatched data types (e.g., strings and integers).
    - **Suggestion:** Use formatted strings (f-strings) or `str.format()` for clearer and more secure output:
      ```python
      print(f""Product Name: {product_name}"")
      print(""Product Price: ${:.2f}"".format(product_price))
      print(f""Product Quantity: {product_quantity}"")
      print(f""Product On Sale: {'Yes' if product_on_sale else 'No'}"")
      ```

3. **Arithmetic Operations:**
    - **Issue:** `total_inventory_value = product_price * product_quantity` currently involves a string operation, causing runtime errors.
    - **Solution:** Ensure `product_price` and `product_quantity` are proper numeric types. Then:
      ```python
      total_inventory_value = product_price * product_quantity
      print(f""Total Inventory Value: ${total_inventory_value:.2f}"")
      ```

4. **Updating Inventory Quantities:**
    - **Issue:** Updating `product_quantity` with a string literal (""5"") will cause a type error.
    - **Solution:** 
      ```python
      product_quantity -= 5
      print(f""Updated Product Quantity: {product_quantity}"")
      ```

5. **Conditional Sale Check:**
    - **Review:** Your conditional check `if product_on_sale:` is correct assuming `product_on_sale` is of type Boolean.
    - **Improvement:** Print informative messages utilizing variable states, e.g., `print(""The product is on sale!"")`

**Problem Statement: Exploring the Basics of Variables and Data Types in Python**

**Objective:**
The purpose of this assignment is to help you understand and practice using different data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. You will learn how to declare and manipulate variables of these types to perform basic operations.

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are developing a simple program for a small retail store to manage inventory and sales. The program needs to keep track of the following information for a single product:

1. **Product Name:** The name of the product (e.g., ""Wireless Mouse"").
2. **Product Price:** The price of the product (e.g., 25.99).
3. **Product Quantity:** The quantity of the product available in stock (e.g., 50).
4. **Product On Sale:** A boolean indicating whether the product is currently on sale (e.g., True or False).

Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Declare Variables:**
   - Declare a variable for each of the four pieces of information mentioned above and initialize them with appropriate values.

2. **Display Product Information:**
   - Print the product information in a user-friendly format. For example:
     
     Product Name: Wireless Mouse
     Product Price: $25.99
     Product Quantity: 50
     Product On Sale: Yes
     

3. **Calculate Total Value of Inventory:**
   - Calculate the total value of the inventory for this product (i.e., Product Price * Product Quantity) and store it in a variable. Print this value with a descriptive message.

4. **Update Inventory:**
   - Simulate a sale where 5 units of the product are sold. Update the product quantity accordingly and print the new quantity.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - Write a conditional statement to check if the product is on sale. If it is, print a message indicating that customers can enjoy a discount. If not, print a message that the product is sold at regular price.

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate data types for each variable.
- Ensure the output is well-formatted and easy to read.
- Use comments in your code to describe each step and the purpose of your variables.
- Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

**Additional Challenge (Optional):**

- Modify your program to allow the user to input the product information instead of hardcoding the values. Use the `input()` function to gather data from the user.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit your Python script file named `inventory_manager.py`.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and meets all the requirements stated above.

By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of how variables and different data types are used in programming, setting the stage for more complex operations and data manipulations.

     - Initialize `product_price` as a float. _Example: `product_price = 25.99`._
     - Initialize `product_quantity` as an integer. _Example: `product_quantity = 50`._
     - Initialize `product_on_sale` as a boolean, parsing it correctly. _Example: `product_on_sale = True`._

2. **Display Product Information:**
   - **Issue:** The `print` statement for the product price does not format the float as currency.
   - **Suggestion:** Use formatted strings to display money values. _Example: `""${:.2f}"".format(product_price)`._
   
3. **Variable Naming and Comments:**
   - **Issue:** The code lacks comments that describe each step or explain the purpose of variables.
   - **Suggestion:** Add comments to improve code readability and clarity. _Example: `# Declaring a variable for each piece of product information`._

4. **Calculate Total Inventory Value:**
   - **Issue:** The calculated `total_inventory_value` is printed but not formatted to two decimal places.
   - **Suggestion:** Format the output to maintain a consistent and professional presentation. _Example: `""Total Inventory Value: ${:.2f}"".format(total_inventory_value)`._

5. **Product On Sale Status:**
   - **Issue:** The check for `product_on_sale` uses string comparison.
   - **Suggestion:** Maintain `product_on_sale` as a boolean (True/False) and adjust the conditional statement accordingly. _Example: `if product_on_sale:`._

6. **Flexibility in Code:**
   - **Suggestion for improvement:** Consider implementing the optional challenge to take user input for enhanced flexibility and interactivity. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of input functions and user interaction.

Previous Score: 4

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
"
problem3_statement,problem3-4pt.txt,6,"### Feedback:

1. **Variable Declaration:** 
   - The student has declared the variables but made minor mistakes in the data types:
     - `product_quantity` is a string ('50') instead of an integer.
     - `product_on_sale` is a string (""False"") instead of a boolean.

2. **Display Product Information:** 
   - The student correctly displays the product information.
   - However, the 'Product Price' should be formatted to two decimal places and 'Product On Sale' should print ""Yes"" or ""No"" for user-friendliness.

3. **Total Inventory Calculation:**
   - The student properly handles potential errors with a `try-except` block.
   - Correctly converts `product_quantity` from a string to an integer for calculation.
   - The error handling is effective but warrants correct initial variable declaration to avoid unnecessary error management.

4. **Update Inventory:**
   - Again, potential type errors are handled using `try-except`, though proper initial variable declaration should eliminate the need for this.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - The logical condition for checking if the product is on sale should utilize the boolean data type rather than comparison with a string (""True"").
   - Prints the correct message based on the sale status.

### Suggestions:

- **Correct Data Types:**
  - Ensure that `product_quantity` is an integer and `product_on_sale` is a boolean right from the declaration phase.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - Format the `product_price` and `total_inventory_value` with two decimal places.
  - Convert the `product_on_sale` boolean to ""Yes""/""No"" for better readability during print.

- **Code Optimization:**
  - With correct data type initialization, you can remove the `try-except` blocks addressing type conversion errors.

- **Consistency:**
  - Follow the provided model solution closely to meet all specific problem requirements.

### Overall:
The student's code demonstrates a reasonable understanding of Python basics and attempts to incorporate error handling, but it lacks precise initial data type assignment and user-friendly output formatting. Increasing familiarity with correct data types and additional formatting methods would enhance the solution.","

   ```python
   product_quantity = 50  # Correct type: Integer
   product_on_sale = False  # Correct type: Boolean
   ```
   
2. **Output Formatting for Total Inventory Value:**  
   - The total inventory value should be formatted to two decimal places to match currency representation.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   print(""Total Inventory Value: ${:.2f}"".format(total_inventory_value))
   ```
   
3. **Use of Try-Except Blocks:**  
   - While using try-except is a good practice for handling errors, it is not required here as long as the data types are correctly initialized.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   - Ensure all variables are initialized with the correct types to avoid unnecessary error handling for basic operations.

4. **Proper Use of String Format for `product_price`:**
   - To ensure consistent currency formatting, the output of `product_price` should utilize the `format` method.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   print(""Product Price: ${:.2f}"".format(product_price))
   ```

5. **Conditional Statement Logic: `product_on_sale`:**
   - Differentiate between boolean and string comparison for clarity and accuracy.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   if product_on_sale:
       print(""This product is currently on sale! Enjoy the discount."")
   else:
       print(""This product is sold at regular price."")
   ```

**Problem Statement: Exploring the Basics of Variables and Data Types in Python**

**Objective:**
The purpose of this assignment is to help you understand and practice using different data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. You will learn how to declare and manipulate variables of these types to perform basic operations.

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are developing a simple program for a small retail store to manage inventory and sales. The program needs to keep track of the following information for a single product:

1. **Product Name:** The name of the product (e.g., ""Wireless Mouse"").
2. **Product Price:** The price of the product (e.g., 25.99).
3. **Product Quantity:** The quantity of the product available in stock (e.g., 50).
4. **Product On Sale:** A boolean indicating whether the product is currently on sale (e.g., True or False).

Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Declare Variables:**
   - Declare a variable for each of the four pieces of information mentioned above and initialize them with appropriate values.

2. **Display Product Information:**
   - Print the product information in a user-friendly format. For example:
     
     Product Name: Wireless Mouse
     Product Price: $25.99
     Product Quantity: 50
     Product On Sale: Yes
     

3. **Calculate Total Value of Inventory:**
   - Calculate the total value of the inventory for this product (i.e., Product Price * Product Quantity) and store it in a variable. Print this value with a descriptive message.

4. **Update Inventory:**
   - Simulate a sale where 5 units of the product are sold. Update the product quantity accordingly and print the new quantity.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - Write a conditional statement to check if the product is on sale. If it is, print a message indicating that customers can enjoy a discount. If not, print a message that the product is sold at regular price.

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate data types for each variable.
- Ensure the output is well-formatted and easy to read.
- Use comments in your code to describe each step and the purpose of your variables.
- Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

**Additional Challenge (Optional):**

- Modify your program to allow the user to input the product information instead of hardcoding the values. Use the `input()` function to gather data from the user.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit your Python script file named `inventory_manager.py`.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and meets all the requirements stated above.

By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of how variables and different data types are used in programming, setting the stage for more complex operations and data manipulations.

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Exploring the Basics of Variables and Data Types in Python**

**Objective:**
The purpose of this assignment is to help you understand and practice using different data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. You will learn how to declare and manipulate variables of these types to perform basic operations.

**Problem Description:**

Imagine you are developing a simple program for a small retail store to manage inventory and sales. The program needs to keep track of the following information for a single product:

1. **Product Name:** The name of the product (e.g., ""Wireless Mouse"").
2. **Product Price:** The price of the product (e.g., 25.99).
3. **Product Quantity:** The quantity of the product available in stock (e.g., 50).
4. **Product On Sale:** A boolean indicating whether the product is currently on sale (e.g., True or False).

Your task is to write a Python script that performs the following steps:

1. **Declare Variables:**
   - Declare a variable for each of the four pieces of information mentioned above and initialize them with appropriate values.

2. **Display Product Information:**
   - Print the product information in a user-friendly format. For example:
     
     Product Name: Wireless Mouse
     Product Price: $25.99
     Product Quantity: 50
     Product On Sale: Yes
     

3. **Calculate Total Value of Inventory:**
   - Calculate the total value of the inventory for this product (i.e., Product Price * Product Quantity) and store it in a variable. Print this value with a descriptive message.

4. **Update Inventory:**
   - Simulate a sale where 5 units of the product are sold. Update the product quantity accordingly and print the new quantity.

5. **Check Sale Status:**
   - Write a conditional statement to check if the product is on sale. If it is, print a message indicating that customers can enjoy a discount. If not, print a message that the product is sold at regular price.

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate data types for each variable.
- Ensure the output is well-formatted and easy to read.
- Use comments in your code to describe each step and the purpose of your variables.
- Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

**Additional Challenge (Optional):**

- Modify your program to allow the user to input the product information instead of hardcoding the values. Use the `input()` function to gather data from the user.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit your Python script file named `inventory_manager.py`.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and meets all the requirements stated above.

By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of how variables and different data types are used in programming, setting the stage for more complex operations and data manipulations.

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",9,"The student's code is largely correct and follows the problem statement closely. It demonstrates a good understanding of control structures, loops, and conditional statements in Python. Here are some strengths and suggestions to improve further:

### Strengths:
1. **Initialization**: The forest grid and player's starting position are correctly initialized, and all necessary variables for navigation and treasure collection are in place.

2. **User Interaction & Control Flow**: The code effectively handles user input for movement and ensures players cannot move outside the grid boundaries.

3. **Logical Progression**: The control structures implement the game's logic well, checking for treasures, traps, and the exit in a clear and concise manner.

4. **User Feedback**: Informative messages are displayed to guide the player, enhancing the user experience.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Exit Condition**: Currently, the loop condition `while treasures_collected < total_treasures or forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] != 'O'` might allow continuation when all treasures are collected but not at the exit. Revising to 
   `while treasures_collected < total_treasures or (treasures_collected == total_treasures and forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] != 'O'):`
   would be clearer.

2. **Enhance User Interaction**: Notify users if they attempt an invalid move due to reaching a grid boundary separately from invalid directions like entering non-directional input.

3. **Code Organization**: Consider encapsulating repeated or related logic into functions (e.g., checking a valid move) for enhanced readability and maintainability.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handling potential edge cases, like entering `q` to quit the game, could add robustness to user interaction.

Overall, the student did a commendable job on this task, displaying a good handle on the essential programming concepts required to tackle such problems effectively.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",3,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

It's clear that the student has started to set up the initial structure of the program, but significant components required to solve the problem are missing. Below are the key areas of improvement:

1. **Missing Grid Initialization:**
   - The forest grid hasn't been initialized, which is essential for determining the player's current position and surrounding conditions (e.g., treasure or trap).

2. **Missing Input Loop:**
   - There is no loop to accept user input for moves (Up, Down, Left, Right) and update the player's position accordingly. The absence of control flow mechanisms such as loops (`while`) and conditionals (`if-else`) means player actions can't be processed.

3. **No Direction Dictionary:**
   - There's no dictionary mapping directions to coordinate offsets, which is crucial for calculating new positions.

4. **Absence of Game Logic:**
   - Essential game logic to handle interactions with grid elements, such as collecting treasures, stepping on traps, or reaching the exit, is completely missing.

5. **Game Over Condition Prematurely Reached:**
   - The message ""Game over."" is displayed directly after the welcome message without any gameplay in between.

### Suggestions to Fix the Issues

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: 
    ```python
    forest_grid = [
        ['E', 'E', 'T', 'X', 'E'],
        ['E', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
        ['E', 'T', 'X', 'E', 'E'],
        ['E', 'E', 'E', 'T', 'E'],
        ['E', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'O']
    ]
    ```

2. **Create a Directions Dictionary**: 
    ```python
    directions = {'Up': (-1, 0), 'Down': (1, 0), 'Left': (0, -1), 'Right': (0, 1)}
    ```

3. **Implement Main Game Loop and Input Handling**:
    ```python
    while treasures_collected < total_treasures or forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] != 'O':
        move = input(""Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): "").strip()
        if move in directions:
            new_position = (player_position[0] + directions[move][0],
                           player_position[1] + directions[move][1])
            # Add logic for boundary and grid element checking
    ```

4. **Add Logic for Interaction with Grid Elements**:
    - Use `if-elif-else` to handle treasures ('T'), traps ('X'), exit ('O'), and empty spaces ('E'), reflecting on the player's treasures collected and game status.

5. **Validate Moves**:
   - Ensure player movement remains within the grid boundaries and manage invalid inputs or movements accordingly.

Once these suggestions are implemented, the code would better adhere to the problem requirements, allowing for a functional and interactive game experience. Currently, due to the incomplete state of the submission, a score of **3** is appropriate, indicating the need for further development.","

### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**
    - **1 point**: The program provides clear and accurate messages to the user for each action (e.g., moving, collecting treasures, encountering traps).
    - **0.5 points**: The program provides messages but with some inaccuracies or omissions.
    - **0 points**: The program does not provide user feedback or messages.

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the problem statement is evaluated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the student's ability to implement control structures, loops, and user interaction in a programming context.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",2,"Upon reevaluating the student's submission, it remains evident that the implementation is very incomplete and only meets the minimum threshold in one category. However, revisiting the solution reveals the student did initiate the adventure setup with welcome messaging, which provides a sense of the game's beginning even without further progression.

Observing the entire assessment:

1. **Grid Initialization**: Still absent.
2. **User Input Handling**: Not addressed.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: Can't be addressed without inputs/grid.
4. **Conditional Statements**: Not present.
5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent**: Not implemented.
6. **Looping Structure**: Still missing.
7. **Treasure Collection Logic**: No mechanism.
8. **Trap Encounter Handling**: Not covered.
9. **Exit Condition**: No implementation.
10. **User Feedback and Messaging**: Beyond just a welcome, the program gives an overall start and end structure.

Given the introduction and structure elements injected into the format of the code, an additional half-point can reflect this very basic groundwork. Thus, a total score of **2** is assigned.

While this is only a small improvement, it still reflects an acknowledgment of initial setup attempts, albeit inadequate for functional gameplay. Emphasis should be on observable progressions in future submissions.","

"
problem4_statement,problem4-2pt.txt,6,"### Feedback

The student's code provides a basic implementation of the enchanted forest adventure game; however, there are several important elements missing or needing improvement:

1. **Initialization Accuracy**:
   - The grid should have exactly 3 treasures as specified in the problem description, but the student's grid only has 2 treasures, which unbalances the game objective.

2. **Boundary Checking**:
   - The code does not check if the new position is within the grid limits before moving, potentially leading to index errors.

3. **Completion Conditions**:
   - The main while loop does not consider the condition to end the game when all treasures are collected and the exit is reached, which should be a primary loop condition instead of using `while True`.
   
4. **Game Objectives**:
   - The game ends when the player finds the exit, regardless of whether all treasures are collected. It should only allow exiting if all treasures are collected.

5. **User Guidance and Edge Cases**:
   - There is no handling or feedback for attempts to move into grid boundaries or improper handling of loop continuation after invalid moves.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
   - **Grid Update**: Ensure the forest grid meets the requirements, especially the treasures count.
   - **Add Boundary Checks**: Include checks for moving outside the grid and give feedback for such invalid movements.
   - **Game Loop Logic**: Revise the loop condition to update the game's completion based on collecting all treasures before allowing reaching the exit.
   - **Player Movement Refactor**: Consider protecting steps with checks before updating the `player_position`.
   - **Testing and Validation**: Test the game with various input combinations and edge cases to ensure robust behavior and player experience.
   
The code provides a good basic foundation but requires improvements to fully align with the problem description and refine the user experience.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"**Analysis of the Student's Code:**

1. **Grid Initialization and Variables:**
 - **Issue:** The student has initialized the grid in a different arrangement from the model solution, which may affect the game's logic. Ensure that traps, treasures, and exits are in the prescribed positions.
 - **Suggestion:** Match the grid layout to the given problem for consistency. Ensure that there are exactly 3 treasures.

2. **Movement Logic:**
 - **Issue:** No check is performed to ensure the player doesn't move out of boundaries.
 - **Suggestion:** Implement boundary checks before updating the `player_position`. A typical boundary check would ensure that new positions remain within grid's dimensions.
```python
if 0 <= new_position[0] < len(forest_grid) and 0 <= new_position[1] < len(forest_grid[0]):
   player_position = new_position
else:
   print(""Invalid move. Out of boundaries."")
```

3. **Termination Condition:**
 - **Issue:** The loop lacks a clear termination condition related to collecting all treasures.
 - **Suggestion:** Add a loop termination condition that ensures players cannot finish until all treasures are collected. This might involve adjusting logic when the player encounters the exit `O`.
```python
elif current_location == 'O':
  if treasures_collected == 3:
     print(""Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!"")
     break
  else:
     print(""You found the exit, but you need to collect all treasures first."")
```

4. **Modifying the Grid State:**
 - **Issue:** Every time a treasure is collected, the grid is not updated to reflect the collected state.
 - **Suggestion:** Update grid to mark a treasure collected by replacing 'T' with 'E' once it's picked up.
```python
forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] = 'E'
```

5. **Code Enhancement Considerations:**
 - Consider using constants or enums for grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`) to increase readability and reduce errors.
 - Improve user input handling to mitigate invalid moves without penalizing attempts due to input typos or mistakes.

**Score Justification:**
While the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem requirements and has structured the loop correctly, significant improvements in movement validation, game state checks, and grid initialization are necessary. While the basic mechanics are operational, elements like boundary checks, treasure collection validation, and movement structure need enhancement. Thus, a score of **6** reflects the incomplete implementation with notable room for improvement.","

Provide your response in structured JSON format.
",7,"Here is the evaluation of the student's code based on the provided rubric:

1. **Grid Initialization (0.5 points)**: 
   - The grid is initialized but does not match the model solution exactly, particularly in the placement of the treasures and traps. One treasure (`T`) is placed a space where a trap was expected.

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**: 
   - The program handles user input correctly and interprets four movement directions.

3. **Boundary Conditions (0 points)**: 
   - The program does not prevent players from moving outside the grid boundaries. This logic is missing in the implementation.

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**:
   - The program uses `if` and `else` statements effectively to check the grid position after each move.

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: 
   - The program uses a series of conditional (`if-elif-else`) statements to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

6. **Looping Structure (0.5 points)**: 
   - The program uses a `while` loop, but it does not correctly implement stopping conditions based on collecting all treasures and finding the exit.

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**: 
   - The program correctly tracks and updates the number of treasures collected.

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**:
   - The program correctly ends the game with a message if the player steps on a trap.

9. **Exit Condition (0 points)**:
   - The program does not check whether all treasures have been collected when finding the exit, leading to incorrect game completion.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**: 
    - The program provides clear feedback to the user for each action, including moving, collecting treasures, and encountering traps.

**Overall Score: 7/10** 

**Feedback Summary**:
The student's code is mostly functional but missing a few key elements, such as handling grid boundaries and ensuring all treasures are collected before finding the exit. Adding boundary checks and completing exit conditions would significantly improve the flow and correctness of the program. Additionally, aligning the grid with the exact layout in the problem description will improve initial setup accuracy.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

",6,"### Revised Evaluation:

1. **Grid Initialization (0.5 points)**:
   - The grid does not match the example solution in treasure positions and this causes game rule conflicts.

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**:
   - Handles input properly with four valid directions recognized and processed. 

3. **Boundary Conditions (0 points)**:
   - Lacks boundary checks; the player can move outside the grid, crucial for a correct gameplay experience.

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**:
   - Utilizes `if` and `else` effectively to evaluate grid positions accurately.

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: 
   - Uses `if-elif-else` logically to manage different types of grid elements (`T`, `X`, `O`, `E`).

6. **Looping Structure (0.5 points)**:
   - Employs a `while` loop but lacks appropriate game-ending conditions based on treasures.

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**:
   - Correctly tracks and updates treasure count as the player finds treasures.

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**:
   - Correctly terminates the game and delivers a message if a trap is encountered.

9. **Exit Condition (0 points)**:
   - Fails to correctly validate treasure collection for exit, contradicting key gameplay logic.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**:
    - Provides accurate, helpful feedback to the player, enhancing communication of actions and game status.

### Final Justification:
While the student's program contains many functional components, crucial game rule checks and setup are missing or implemented mistakenly. As such, elements like boundary constraints and ensuring the player only exits after collecting all treasures are critical and not fully realized, leading to a slight reduction in score.","

    - **0.5 points**: The program provides messages but with some inaccuracies or omissions.
    - **0 points**: The program does not provide user feedback or messages.

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the problem statement is evaluated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the student's ability to implement control structures, loops, and user interaction in a programming context.

Previous Feedback:
Here is the evaluation of the student's code based on the provided rubric:

1. **Grid Initialization (0.5 points)**: 
   - The grid is initialized but does not match the model solution exactly, particularly in the placement of the treasures and traps. One treasure (`T`) is placed a space where a trap was expected.

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**: 
   - The program handles user input correctly and interprets four movement directions.

3. **Boundary Conditions (0 points)**: 
   - The program does not prevent players from moving outside the grid boundaries. This logic is missing in the implementation.

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**:
   - The program uses `if` and `else` statements effectively to check the grid position after each move.

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: 
   - The program uses a series of conditional (`if-elif-else`) statements to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

6. **Looping Structure (0.5 points)**: 
   - The program uses a `while` loop, but it does not correctly implement stopping conditions based on collecting all treasures and finding the exit.

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**: 
   - The program correctly tracks and updates the number of treasures collected.

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**:
   - The program correctly ends the game with a message if the player steps on a trap.

9. **Exit Condition (0 points)**:
   - The program does not check whether all treasures have been collected when finding the exit, leading to incorrect game completion.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**: 
    - The program provides clear feedback to the user for each action, including moving, collecting treasures, and encountering traps.

**Overall Score: 7/10** 

**Feedback Summary**:
The student's code is mostly functional but missing a few key elements, such as handling grid boundaries and ensuring all treasures are collected before finding the exit. Adding boundary checks and completing exit conditions would significantly improve the flow and correctness of the program. Additionally, aligning the grid with the exact layout in the problem description will improve initial setup accuracy.

Previous Score: 7

"
problem4_statement,problem4-4pt.txt,7,"The student's code is functional and demonstrates a good understanding of conditional statements, loops, and basic program flow. There are a few areas of improvement and some missing elements compared to the model solution:

1. **Grid Initialization:**
   - The grid in the student's code does not include an exit (`'O'`), which is crucial as per the problem statement. This oversight means the end goal cannot be properly validated.

2. **Game Completion Conditions:**
   - The code does not check if all treasures have been collected before reaching the exit. It ends the game as soon as an exit is reached. This does not align with the requirement to gather all treasures first.

3. **Output Messages:**
   - While messages are generally clear, an additional check is needed at the exit to ensure all treasures are collected before the game is declared completed.

4. **Reset Collected Treasure Markers:**
   - It would be beneficial to replace the `'T'` with `'E'` after a treasure has been collected to ensure multiple counts cannot mistakenly occur at the same position.

5. **Game Loop:**
   - The current `while True:` loop will result in an infinite loop if traps didn't end the game since there's no additional exit condition characteristic, unlike the model solution.

6. **Improved Validation:**
   - Consider enhancing the user feedback on invalid moves with more descriptive messages or accepting a confirmation to proceed to help users better understand and interact with the game.

Overall, the student has successfully created a functioning base for the game, but minor improvements around game rules and handling specific conditions would enhance the solution considerably.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",5,"### Evaluation of Student Code:

**Strengths:**
- The student has implemented the basic game loop and user interaction effectively. They have employed conditionals and loops to manage the game's flow.
- The grid is initialized correctly, and the movement logic determines the player's new position based on user input.
- Boundaries are checked to prevent the player from moving outside the grid limits.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Victory Condition:**
   - The student code doesn't handle the correct condition for winning the game. The adventure ends upon reaching the exit ('O'), but it doesn't check if all treasures are collected beforehand.
   - **Fix:** Before allowing the player to proceed through the exit, ensure all treasures are collected:
     ```python
     if current_location == 'O':
         if treasures_collected == total_treasures:
             print(""Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!"")
             return
         else:
             print(""You found the exit, but you need to collect all treasures first."")
     ```

2. **Treasure Re-collection Issue:**
   - There's no mechanism that marks a treasure position as empty once collected. This can lead to incorrect treasure counts if the player revisits a treasure position.
   - **Fix:** After collecting a treasure, update the forest grid to reflect that it has been collected:
     ```python
     if current_location == 'T':
         treasures_collected += 1
         forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] = 'E' # Mark treasure as collected
         print(f""You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: {treasures_collected}"")
     ```

3. **Lack of an Exit Statement:**
   - The `while` loop lacks a clear condition to terminate beyond encountering an exit or trap. 
   - **Fix:** Integrate a condition to stop the game once all treasures have been collected and the player has found the exit.

**Overall Suggestions:**
- Ensure all edge cases are covered, such as revisiting already collected treasures and correctly handling the winning condition by checking collected treasures.

**Conclusion:**
The fundamental structure captures the game's mechanics, but improvements are necessary to ensure correct victory conditions and avoid errors in treasure handling. With these changes, the student code will align more closely with the problem requirements and deliver a proper game-playing experience.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the problem statement is evaluated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the student's ability to implement control structures, loops, and user interaction in a programming context.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",7,"Upon reevaluation of the student's code and the previously assigned feedback, the following considerations were taken into account:

1. **Grid Initialization (0.5 points)**: The grid was initialized but missed the exit ('O') position, which is crucial for completing the game logic.

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**: The code handles user inputs efficiently, covering all movement directions without errors.

3. **Boundary Conditions (1 point)**: Boundary checks are correctly implemented, preventing the player from moving outside the grid.

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**: Effective use of conditional statements to check the grid's current position and handle different cases appropriately.

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: An equivalent structure (if-elif statements) is used adeptly to switch between required actions.

6. **Looping Structure (0.5 points)**: While the loop effectively runs the game, it lacks proper termination once treasures are collected and the exit is found. 

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (0.5 points)**: Although treasures are collected correctly, their state is not modified post-collection, potentially causing logic errors down the line.

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**: Proper end-game mechanism when stepping on a trap, as required by the logic.

9. **Exit Condition (0.5 points)**: The condition to check all treasures before finding the exit is not effectively integrated, hence only partial marks.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (0.5 points)**: Messaging is mostly accurate but could receive enhancements for clarity and comprehensive journey guidance.

Overall, the student correctly covers major aspects of the problem statement, including input handling, boundary checks, conditional logic, and game-ending scenarios. However, minor issues with the grid initialization, treasure state maintenance, and comprehensive exit conditions were noted. Given these observations, the initial score of 7 accurately reflects the balance between the functionalities successfully implemented and those requiring improvements.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

",7,"### Evaluation of Student Code

The student has done a decent job of implementing the Enchanted Forest Adventure game. However, there are some key areas that need attention and improvement.

#### Positive Aspects:
1. **Grid Initialization**: The 5x5 grid is well initialized with correct representations for empty spaces, treasures, traps, and the exit.
2. **Player Movement**: Functionality for moving the player within the grid based on user input is correctly implemented.
3. **Boundary Check**: The student correctly checks if the player’s movements keep them within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Detection of Treasures and Traps**: Code correctly identifies when a player encounters a treasure or a trap.

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Game Loop Termination**:
   - The current loop (`while True`) does not have a clear termination condition once all treasures are collected and the exit is reached.
   - **Suggestion**: Replace the infinite loop with a condition that checks if all treasures are collected and the exit is reached to terminate the game successfully.

2. **Handling the Exit ('O')**:
   - If the player reaches the exit without collecting all the treasures, there should be a prompt to gather all treasures first before concluding the game.

3. **Missing Total Treasures Check**:
   - There is no check for the total number of treasures before reaching the exit.
   - **Suggestion**: Add a condition to check if `treasures_collected` equals `total_treasures` before allowing the game to end at the exit.

4. **Dynamic User Guidance**:
   - When the exit is found without collecting all treasures, inform the player about missing treasures before allowing game completion.

5. **Code Clarification**: 
   - It might be beneficial to give more informative output messages, especially when transitioning between different locations within the forest.
   - Consider adding additional comments within the code for clarity on key operations and decision branches.

### Additional Consideration:
- Implement retries for invalid input, which can improve usability.

Overall, the code functions well, but addressing the above points will lead towards a more complete implementation. With corrections and enhancements, the program will provide a smoother and more coherent user experience.","

",6,"The student's code adequately captures many facets of the problem, yet there are areas that need improvement. Here's the evaluation based on the rubric:

1. **Grid Initialization (1 point)**: 
   - The grid is correctly initialized with predefined positions. (**1 point**)

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**:
   - The code prompts the user for input and handles all movement directions correctly. (**1 point**)

3. **Boundary Conditions (1 point)**:
   - Player movement respects grid boundaries, preventing out-of-grid moves. (**1 point**)

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**:
   - Uses `if` and `else` structures correctly to determine game actions based on current grid position. (**1 point**)

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: 
   - The `if-else` structure is correctly used to handle different grid elements, but lacks the structure to distinguish final conditions (treasures collected vs. visiting exit early). (**0.5 points**)

6. **Looping Structure (1 point)**:
   - The loop runs continuously (`while True`) but doesn't terminate on correct win condition; it only checks for exit without ensuring treasures are collected. (**0.5 points**)

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**:
   - Correctly tracks and updates the number of treasures collected. (**1 point**)

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**: 
   - Properly ends the game if the player steps on a trap. (**1 point**)

9. **Exit Condition (1 point)**:
   - The code detects reaching the exit but doesn't ensure all treasures are collected before acknowledging completion. (**0 points**)

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**:
    - Although functional, it can be misleading because it indicates finding the exit regardless of treasures collected. Messages need more clarity. (**0.5 points**)

### **Additional Feedback**: 
- **End Game Logic**: To better control ending the game, validate that all treasures are collected before allowing exit realization.
- **User Communication**: Improve user feedback and instructions, particularly when reaching the exit without all treasures.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of control structures and loops but should refine the logic for game conditions and enhance user guidance and messaging.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

   - **0 points**: The program does not correctly handle the exit condition.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**
    - **1 point**: The program provides clear and accurate messages to the user for each action (e.g., moving, collecting treasures, encountering traps).
    - **0.5 points**: The program provides messages but with some inaccuracies or omissions.
    - **0 points**: The program does not provide user feedback or messages.

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the problem statement is evaluated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the student's ability to implement control structures, loops, and user interaction in a programming context.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",7,"After reevaluating the student's work against the rubric and prior feedback, the modification of the score is justified for the following reasons:

**Strengths:**
1. **Grid Initialization:** Correct and accurate.
2. **User Input Handling:** User input for movement directions functions perfectly.
3. **Boundary Conditions:** The code expertly prevents boundary violations.
4. **Conditional Statements:** Successfully applies `if-else` logic to verify player's move and handle corresponding actions.
5. **Treasure Collection Logic:** Appropriately tracks treasures with accurate updates.
6. **Trap Encounter Handling:** Ends the game accurately upon encountering a trap.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Switch or Equivalent Structure:** The code attempts using `if-else` to manage grid elements, but lacks discernment of all conditions before proceeding, especially for game end assumptions with the exit. Slight enhancement needed in logical flow.
2. **Looping Structure:** Although the use of `while True` works, the termination conditions for a win scenario aren't fully realized. Adjustment needed to check the collection status of all treasures before declaring success at exit.
3. **Exit Condition & User Messaging:** Needs clear conditions ensuring all treasures are collected before allowing positive exit messages. Messages lack clarity and can be misleading for the current state of treasure collection upon reaching the exit.

The student makes a clear effort, producing a working code base that correctly captures most functionalities while missing some edge cases. Thus, recommending an increase to a **7** to better reflect near-complete functionality, with minor improvements necessary in final game logic and user messaging.","

Rubric:
Creating a grading rubric for the ""Adventure in the Enchanted Forest"" problem statement involves breaking down the task into specific, measurable criteria. Here's a 10-point rubric that evaluates the key components of the task:

1. **Grid Initialization (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly initializes a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit.
   - **0.5 points**: The grid is initialized but contains errors in the placement of treasures, traps, or the exit.
   - **0 points**: The grid is not initialized or is completely incorrect.

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly prompts the user for input and handles all four movement directions.
   - **0.5 points**: The program prompts for input but does not handle all movement directions correctly.
   - **0 points**: The program does not prompt for user input or fails to handle input correctly.

3. **Boundary Conditions (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program prevents the player from moving outside the grid boundaries.
   - **0.5 points**: The program partially prevents boundary violations but has some errors.
   - **0 points**: The program allows the player to move outside the grid boundaries.

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program uses `if` and `else` statements effectively to check grid positions after each move.
   - **0.5 points**: The program uses conditional statements but with some logical errors.
   - **0 points**: The program does not use conditional statements correctly.

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program uses a `switch` statement or equivalent `if-else if` structure to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).
   - **0.5 points**: The program uses a `switch` or equivalent structure but with errors.
   - **0 points**: The program does not use a `switch` or equivalent structure.

6. **Looping Structure (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program uses a `while` loop to keep the game running until all treasures are collected and the exit is found.
   - **0.5 points**: The program uses a loop but does not correctly implement the stopping condition.
   - **0 points**: The program does not use a loop or uses it incorrectly.

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly tracks and updates the number of treasures collected.
   - **0.5 points**: The program tracks treasures but with some errors in updating.
   - **0 points**: The program does not track treasure collection.

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program ends the game with a message if the player steps on a trap.
   - **0.5 points**: The program detects traps but does not end the game correctly.
   - **0 points**: The program does not handle trap encounters.

9. **Exit Condition (1 point)**
   - **1 point**: The program correctly identifies when the player finds the exit after collecting all treasures and ends the game with a congratulatory message.
   - **0.5 points**: The program identifies the exit but does not check for all treasures collected.
   - **0 points**: The program does not correctly handle the exit condition.

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**
    - **1 point**: The program provides clear and accurate messages to the user for each action (e.g., moving, collecting treasures, encountering traps).
    - **0.5 points**: The program provides messages but with some inaccuracies or omissions.
    - **0 points**: The program does not provide user feedback or messages.

This rubric ensures that each aspect of the problem statement is evaluated, providing a comprehensive assessment of the student's ability to implement control structures, loops, and user interaction in a programming context.

Previous Feedback:
The student's code adequately captures many facets of the problem, yet there are areas that need improvement. Here's the evaluation based on the rubric:

1. **Grid Initialization (1 point)**: 
   - The grid is correctly initialized with predefined positions. (**1 point**)

2. **User Input Handling (1 point)**:
   - The code prompts the user for input and handles all movement directions correctly. (**1 point**)

3. **Boundary Conditions (1 point)**:
   - Player movement respects grid boundaries, preventing out-of-grid moves. (**1 point**)

4. **Conditional Statements (1 point)**:
   - Uses `if` and `else` structures correctly to determine game actions based on current grid position. (**1 point**)

5. **Switch Statement or Equivalent (1 point)**: 
   - The `if-else` structure is correctly used to handle different grid elements, but lacks the structure to distinguish final conditions (treasures collected vs. visiting exit early). (**0.5 points**)

6. **Looping Structure (1 point)**:
   - The loop runs continuously (`while True`) but doesn't terminate on correct win condition; it only checks for exit without ensuring treasures are collected. (**0.5 points**)

7. **Treasure Collection Logic (1 point)**:
   - Correctly tracks and updates the number of treasures collected. (**1 point**)

8. **Trap Encounter Handling (1 point)**: 
   - Properly ends the game if the player steps on a trap. (**1 point**)

9. **Exit Condition (1 point)**:
   - The code detects reaching the exit but doesn't ensure all treasures are collected before acknowledging completion. (**0 points**)

10. **User Feedback and Messaging (1 point)**:
    - Although functional, it can be misleading because it indicates finding the exit regardless of treasures collected. Messages need more clarity. (**0.5 points**)

### **Additional Feedback**: 
- **End Game Logic**: To better control ending the game, validate that all treasures are collected before allowing exit realization.
- **User Communication**: Improve user feedback and instructions, particularly when reaching the exit without all treasures.

The student demonstrates a good understanding of control structures and loops but should refine the logic for game conditions and enhance user guidance and messaging.

problem4_statement,problem4-8pt.txt,8,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - The student correctly initialized the forest grid, player position, directions, and treasures count, which follows the problem statement's guidelines.

2. **Game Loop and Logic**:
   - The `while` loop condition correctly checks for the collection of all treasures or reaching the exit.
   - It effectively handles user input and calculates the new position without any syntax errors.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The `if` statements to check the grid elements ('T', 'X', 'O', 'E') are accurate and comprehensive.
   - The student uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to process different grid scenarios, similar to the model solution.

4. **Output**:
   - The output messages for each action (treasure collection, stepping on a trap, finding the exit, and moving to an empty space) are clear and informative.

5. **Boundary Management**:
   - The code correctly prohibits movement outside the grid boundaries by printing a message and not updating the player position.

6. **Areas for Improvement**:
   - The student could benefit from adding comments to explain the logic for better readability and maintainability.
   - The grid elements are not marked as 'E' after collecting a treasure, which could be a future improvement to keep track of visited locations more accurately.

7. **Overall**:
   - The program functions correctly according to the problem statement, allowing the player to navigate the forest while collecting treasures and avoiding traps.
   - There might be minor refinements possible for code readability and maintaining state (e.g., marking visited treasures), but the solution meets the problem requirements as it stands.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",8,"The student's code closely follows the model solution and implements the main logic of the game efficiently. Here are a few key points where minor improvements can be made:

1. **Missing Feature - Marking Treasures:**
   - In the current code, treasures are not marked as collected on the grid after finding them. This could potentially allow the player to collect the same treasure more than once. 
   - **Suggestion:**
     After increasing `treasures_collected`, update the grid position from 'T' to 'E' to ensure treasures are marked:
     ```python
     if current_location == 'T':
         treasures_collected += 1
         forest_grid[player_position[0]][player_position[1]] = 'E' # mark treasure as collected
         print(f""You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: {treasures_collected}"")
     ```

2. **Loop Condition Error:**
   - The while loop condition should be updated for clarity and correctness. Currently, it checks `treasures_collected < total_treasures or `. This implies the game continues if either condition is true, including after all treasures have been collected (and it does not terminate until the exit is found).
   - **Suggestion:** Replace `or` with `and` to properly represent that both conditions need to be met.

3. **Code Robustness - Prompt Use:**
   - If the user inputs a move that is not recognized, there's only a console message but no loop iteration reset to prompt the player again.
   - **Suggestion:** Consider implementing a loop that continues prompting for valid input until received, ensuring the player only makes valid moves.
     ```python
     while move not in directions:
         print(""Invalid input. Please enter Up, Down, Left, or Right."")
         move = input(""Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): "").strip()
     ```

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Adventure in the Enchanted Forest

Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure! As a brave adventurer, your task is to navigate through the forest, collect hidden treasures, and avoid dangerous traps. You will use your newfound knowledge of control structures to make decisions and repeat actions until you achieve your goal.

#### Scenario:

You start at the entrance of the Enchanted Forest with the following objectives:
1. Collect 3 treasures hidden in different parts of the forest.
2. Avoid falling into traps that can end your adventure prematurely.
3. Find the exit to successfully complete your journey.

#### Environment Details:

1. **Locations**: The forest is divided into a grid. Each position in the grid may contain:
   - A treasure (`T`)
   - A trap (`X`)
   - An empty space (`E`)
   - The exit (`O`)

2. **Player Actions**: You can move in four directions:
   - Up
   - Down
   - Left
   - Right

3. **Game Rules**:
   - You start at position `(0, 0)`.
   - You must collect all 3 treasures.
   - You cannot land on a trap.
   - You must find the exit after collecting all treasures.

#### Task:

Write a program to simulate the journey using conditional statements and loops. Your program should:

1. **Initialize the Forest Grid**: Create a 5x5 grid with predefined positions for treasures, traps, and the exit. You can hard-code this grid for simplicity.

2. **User Input**: Prompt the user to decide their next move (Up, Down, Left, Right).

3. **Control Flow**:
   - Use `if` and `else` statements to check the grid position after each move.
   - Implement a `switch` statement (or equivalent if-else if structure) to handle different grid elements (`T`, `X`, `E`, `O`).

4. **Looping**:
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the game running until the player collects all treasures and finds the exit.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over user inputs if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - Display messages to the user when they collect a treasure, encounter a trap, or reach the exit.
   - If the player steps on a trap, end the game with a message.
   - Once all treasures are collected and the exit is found, congratulate the player.

#### Example:

plaintext
Welcome to the Enchanted Forest Adventure!
You are currently at position (0, 0).
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Down
You moved to position (1, 0). It's an empty space.
Choose your move (Up, Down, Left, Right): Right
You found a treasure! Total treasures collected: 1
...
Congratulations! You have collected all treasures and found the exit!


#### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure the player does not move outside the boundaries of the grid.
- Consider edge cases, such as invalid inputs for movement or attempting to move in a direction that doesn't exist.

This exercise will help you understand how to use conditional statements and loops to control program flow, make decisions, and repeat actions based on user inputs. Good luck, and may you find all the treasures in the Enchanted Forest!

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",9,"The student's code for the library management system is very well structured and closely follows the problem requirements. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

### Strengths:
- **Correct Function Implementations**: All function requirements are met, including `add_book`, `remove_book`, `search_book`, and `list_books`. 
- **Proper Use of Parameters and Return Values**: Each function uses parameters and return values accurately to manipulate the library collection.
- **Variable Scope**: Variables are well-scoped within functions, avoiding unnecessary global variables.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: The main menu is intuitive, providing clear prompts for user input.
- **Robust Against Invalid Input**: There's a catch for invalid menu inputs, prompting the user to try again.

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Error Handling**: While there is a check for invalid menu choices, the code could further enhance robustness by adding checks or validations for other inputs, such as verifying the publication year is a valid number.
- **Code Efficiency**: Removing a book involves iterating through the collection to find a match. To improve efficiency, especially as the collection size grows, consider using data structures like a dictionary with titles as keys.

You are a computer science professor teaching introductory programming using Python.

Below is a problem description, an example solution, and a student's code. 
Use the rubric provided to evaluate the code and provide a score (1-10) and feedback. 
The score must be an integer in the range of 1 to 10.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

"
problem5_statement,problem5-0pt.txt,6,"The student's code provides the basic functionality for a Library Management System but lacks several key aspects needed for robustness and clarity. Here’s the evaluation:

## Positives:
1. **Basic Functionality**: Provides options to add, remove, search, and list books. 
2. **Uses List of Dictionaries**: Correctly uses a list of dictionaries to store books.

## Areas for Improvement:
1. **Modular Design**: The student's code is placed within a single function (`library_system`). It should be broken down into smaller, reusable functions as detailed in the problem requirements.
    - **Missing Functions**: `add_book`, `remove_book`, `search_book`, and `list_books` are not implemented as separate functions.
    - **Scope and Reusability**: Function decomposition would help manage variable scope better and allow reusability of code components.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - **Case Sensitivity**: The current implementation of search and remove is case-sensitive, making user interaction less forgiving.
    - **Remove Validation**: Does not check if the book was successfully removed and provides no feedback to the user.
    - **Search Feedback**: No feedback if the book was not found during a search.

3. **User Interaction**:
    - **Feedback Messages**: Add messages to confirm when books are added, removed, or searched for clarifying user actions.
    - **Invalid Input**: There is no handling for invalid menu options or non-numeric year inputs.

4. **Returning Values**:
    - The code does not return values from operations. Although not strictly necessary for this implementation, maintaining a practice of returning appropriate values helps in building scalable applications.

## Conclusion:
The student's solution tackles the core aspects of the Library Management System. By refactoring the code to adhere more closely to modular programming principles, handling errors and inputs effectively, and enhancing user interaction, the solution would significantly improve.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"### Evaluation of Student Code:

1. **Function Modularity and Structure**:
    - The student implemented the entire functionality within a single `library_system()` function. While it works, modularity is not adhered to as required by the problem statement. Proposed Solution:
      - Break the code into separate functions for each operation: `add_book`, `remove_book`, `search_book`, and `list_books` to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability.

2. **Return Values**:
    - The code lacks the return values for operations like `add` returning updated collections, `remove` indicating success or failure, and `search` returning book details. Proposed Solution:
      - Ensure each function returns appropriate data, e.g., `True/False` for remove operations and book details for search operations.

3. **Case Insensitivity in Searches**:
    - The search and remove operations do not handle case insensitivity. This could lead to missed matches during operations. Proposed Solution:
      - Convert titles to lower case in search and remove operations to ensure case insensitivity.

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
    - Better handling of edge cases, such as non-existent titles for removal, is missing. The search operation does not handle cases where books aren't found. Proposed Solution:
      - Implement checks to inform the user when operations like remove or search do not find the book.

5. **Menu Interaction & User Experience**:
    - The user interaction is straightforward but lacks feedback for operations like successful addition or unsuccessful removal. Proposed Solution:
      - Update the user after each operation for successful or unsuccessful actions.

6. **Variable Naming and Scope**:
    - Variable naming is adequate but could be enhanced for clarity. The scope of variables is mostly localized, which is positive.

7. **Function Design Concepts**:
    - The student missed the opportunity to use parameters and return values effectively, which is a core learning objective in this exercise.

### Improvements Needed:
- Break the monolithic `library_system` function into smaller, reusable functions.
- Implement proper return values and enhance case handling in search and remove functions.
- Provide user feedback for all actions, especially when operations fail.

### Conclusion:
- The code showcases basic functionality but lacks the structured approach and robustness required by the assignment. With a few strategic adjustments, the student's solution could be vastly improved, promoting better coding practices.","

",6,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

1. **Functionality of Main Menu (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The main menu is implemented correctly, allowing for user selection and navigation.

2. **Implementation of `add_book` Function (0 points)**
   - No explicit function is implemented. The code integrates adding a book directly within the menu loop instead of using a separate function, losing modularity and reusability.

3. **Implementation of `remove_book` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The removal process is done within the loop. However, it does correctly remove books by title, but it does not return a boolean status.

4. **Implementation of `search_book` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The search feature is implemented but does not return the `None` value explicitly if the book is not found, missing part of the expected functionality.

5. **Implementation of `list_books` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): This functionality is present, but it doesn't handle an empty collection scenario explicitly by indicating to the user that no books are available.

6. **Use of Data Structure (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): Books are stored using a list of dictionaries with correct keys (`title`, `author`, `year`).

7. **User Input Handling (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): User input is mostly handled, but lacks robustness against invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent titles for removal).

8. **Variable Scope and Reusability (0 points)**
   - No Marks (0 points): Functions are not used for each operation, indicating poor reusability. Everything is enclosed in the main loop, reducing clarity and scope management.

9. **Return Values (0 points)**
   - No Marks (0 points): There are no return values handled in functions as they don't exist outside the loop structure. Ideally, should have return values indicating operation success.

10. **Code Clarity and Organization (1 point)**
    - Full Marks (1 point): The code structure within the loop is clear and easy to follow, even though it lacks modular function separation.

### Summary:
While the student code meets the basic requirements and demonstrates an understanding of how to build a command-line based application, it notably lacks function separation, which makes it less modular and reusable. Functions encapsulating specific tasks should be implemented for better design and maintainability. The program should also handle more input edge cases for stronger robustness.","

Below is a problem description, an example solution, and a student's code. 
Use the rubric provided to evaluate the code and provide a score (1-10) and feedback. 
The score must be an integer in the range of 1 to 10.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

   - Functions partially but lacks returning boolean status.

4. **Implementation of `search_book` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partially functions but lacks explicit return of `None` when no book is found.

5. **Implementation of `list_books` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Lists books but fails to handle empty collection gracefully.

6. **Use of Data Structure (1 point)**
   - Full marks for correctly using a list of dictionaries.

7. **User Input Handling (0.5 points)**
   - Inputs are handled but lack validation against invalid or non-existent titles.

8. **Variable Scope and Reusability (0 points)**
   - Fails on scope and reusability due to lack of function separation.

9. **Return Values (0 points)**
   - No structured function return values within the inline implementation.

10. **Code Clarity and Organization (1 point)**
    - Earns full marks for being clear and organized within available constraints.

After considering the lacking function definitions, critical for demonstrating modular programming, and incomplete handling of return values, reducing the score by 1 point is justified to enforce the importance of code modularity and proper function use in such assignments.","

### Evaluation of Student's Code

1. **Functionality of Main Menu (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): The main menu is implemented correctly, allowing for user selection and navigation.

2. **Implementation of `add_book` Function (0 points)**
   - No explicit function is implemented. The code integrates adding a book directly within the menu loop instead of using a separate function, losing modularity and reusability.

3. **Implementation of `remove_book` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The removal process is done within the loop. However, it does correctly remove books by title, but it does not return a boolean status.

4. **Implementation of `search_book` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): The search feature is implemented but does not return the `None` value explicitly if the book is not found, missing part of the expected functionality.

5. **Implementation of `list_books` Function (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): This functionality is present, but it doesn't handle an empty collection scenario explicitly by indicating to the user that no books are available.

6. **Use of Data Structure (1 point)**
   - Full Marks (1 point): Books are stored using a list of dictionaries with correct keys (`title`, `author`, `year`).

7. **User Input Handling (0.5 points)**
   - Partial Marks (0.5 points): User input is mostly handled, but lacks robustness against invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent titles for removal).

8. **Variable Scope and Reusability (0 points)**
   - No Marks (0 points): Functions are not used for each operation, indicating poor reusability. Everything is enclosed in the main loop, reducing clarity and scope management.

9. **Return Values (0 points)**
   - No Marks (0 points): There are no return values handled in functions as they don't exist outside the loop structure. Ideally, should have return values indicating operation success.

10. **Code Clarity and Organization (1 point)**
    - Full Marks (1 point): The code structure within the loop is clear and easy to follow, even though it lacks modular function separation.

### Summary:
While the student code meets the basic requirements and demonstrates an understanding of how to build a command-line based application, it notably lacks function separation, which makes it less modular and reusable. Functions encapsulating specific tasks should be implemented for better design and maintainability. The program should also handle more input edge cases for stronger robustness.

"
problem5_statement,problem5-2pt.txt,4,"### Evaluation of the Student Code:

#### Strengths: 
1. **Basic Functionality**: 
   - The student implemented the `add_book` function correctly, which adds a new book to the collection.
   - The main menu allows the user to add a book and exit the system, functioning as intended for available choices.

2. **Code Structure & Readability**:
   - The use of functions and the main interaction loop demonstrates an understanding of modular programming.
   - The code is readable and maintains a simple structure.

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Incomplete Features**:
   - The student's code lacks several key functionalities outlined in the problem description, such as removing, searching, and listing books. This constitutes a significant portion of the assignment requirements.
   - The add_book function does not return the updated collection, although this is specified in the requirements.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - There is no validation for user inputs, such as checking if the year provided is a valid integer.
   - The main menu lacks handling for invalid menu choices, which might lead to confusion for users.

3. **Function Definitions**:
   - The `add_book` function should include a return statement to reflect the requirements in the problem statement (return updated collection).

4. **Scope and Reusability**:
   - The student should explore defining other functional components (e.g., `remove_book`, `search_book`, `list_books`) even if not fully operational, to exhibit understanding of design principles.

#### Recommendations:
- Extend the program by implementing the missing functions (`remove_book`, `search_book`, `list_books`) to fulfill all problem requirements.
- Incorporate user input validation and error handling to improve robustness and user experience.
- Ensure functions return expected values, improving their reusability.
- Enhance the main menu to handle invalid selections gracefully, with corresponding user feedback.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

   - Functions are not adequately encapsulated for all the required features. The program should also include `remove_book`, `search_book`, and `list_books` functions.

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - The program does not handle invalid input or provide feedback for unsuccessful operations. 

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Complete Functions**:
   - Implement the missing functions (`remove_book`, `search_book`, `list_books`) and integrate them into the main menu options.

2. **Consistent Return Values**:
   - Modify `add_book` to return the updated collection, ensuring consistent usage of return values across functions.

3. **Enhance User Interaction**:
   - Implement adequate prompts and error messages for user inputs and incorrect operations, such as searching or removing non-existent books.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance robustness by adding input validation to prevent invalid or erroneous input values (e.g., non-integer input for menu selection).

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Introduce test cases or explicit verification steps to ensure each function behaves as expected.

Overall, the student has taken a good first step but needs to expand and refine their code to fulfill the complete problem requirements. This also includes more precise function definitions and additional error handling to meet the robustness required by the problem description.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",4,"Upon reevaluating the student's code and the previously assigned feedback based on the rubric, I have decided to adjust the score slightly. While the initial feedback totaled the student's score to 5, it seems generous given the extensive parts of the Library Management System that were left unimplemented. Here's the justification:

1. **Functionality of Main Menu (0.5 points):** The system only offers the options to add a new book and exit. It lacks options for removing, searching, and listing books, hence only partial marks.

2. **Implementation of `add_book` Function (0.5 points):** The function adds a book successfully but does not return the updated collection, which is a key requirement for managing the book data further in the system.

3. **Implementation of `remove_book` Function (0 points):** Not implemented.

4. **Implementation of `search_book` Function (0 points):** Not implemented.

5. **Implementation of `list_books` Function (0 points):** Not implemented.

6. **Use of Data Structure (1 point):** The use of a list of dictionaries is correctly implemented.

7. **User Input Handling (0.5 points):** Basic input handling is present but lacks robustness (e.g., no validation for publication year).

8. **Variable Scope and Reusability (1 point):** Effectively manages variable scope and function reusability without unnecessary globals.

9. **Return Values (0 points):** The failure to return updated collections significantly impacts the system's ability to manage book data.

10. **Code Clarity and Organization (0.5 points):** The code is organized well, but the limited implementation doesn't fully reflect the organizational clarity across more complex operations.

Given the unimplemented functions and partial compliance with the requirements, the overall score is adjusted to a 4 to better reflect the current state of the code as per the rubric's criteria.","

"
problem5_statement,problem5-4pt.txt,8,"The student has made a commendable effort in implementing the Library Management System according to the problem statement. Here's a detailed evaluation based on the problem requirements:

### Evaluation Criteria:

**1. Correct implementation of each function:**
   - **add_book: 9/10** - Correctly adds books. However, it doesn't return the updated collection as specified in the requirements.
   - **remove_book: 8/10** - Correct logic but returns `None` and uses unnecessary `found` flag. Could be streamlined to return `True` or `False`.
   - **search_book: 8/10** - Functions correctly, but should return the book details instead of just printing them, to provide flexibility for further use.
   - **list_books: 9/10** - Lists books correctly but could enhance handling empty collections (e.g., print a specific message).

**2. Proper use of parameters and return values:**
   - Lacks return values in `add_book` and `search_book` functions, which are crucial for reusability and flexibility.

**3. Effective use of variable scope:**
   - Proper use of local variables ensures clear scope separation. 

**4. Clarity and organization of code:**
   - The code is well-organized and structured, each module is encapsulated clearly.

**5. User-friendly interaction and error handling:**
   - Interactions are intuitive, but could benefit from additional input validation (e.g., checking if year is a number, handling case insensitivity in `remove_book`).

### Recommendations:
- **Return Values:** Ensure functions like `add_book`, `search_book`, and `remove_book` return useful information to enhance reusability.
- **Input Validation:** Incorporate better error checks for scenarios like invalid menu choices or incorrect input formats (e.g., non-number years).
- **Error Message:** Include a print statement in `remove_book` when a book is successfully removed for consistency with the interaction pattern.
- **Modular Input Handling:** Consider making separate helper functions for input to improve code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of basic modular programming principles, with room for improvements on return values and error handling to make the system more robust and flexible.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",7,"The student's code does show a good understanding of basic operations in a library management system using functions. However, there are some areas that need improvement to meet the problem's requirements fully.

### Strengths:
1. **Basic Structure and Functionality**: 
   - The student has correctly structured the program using functions, which encapsulates distinct operations like adding, removing, and searching for books.
2. **Functional Operations**: 
   - Functions like `add_book`, `remove_book`, `search_book`, and `list_books` perform as described in the problem statement.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - The main menu is provided for user interaction, which aligns with the requirements.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Return Values in Functions:**
   - Functions like `remove_book` and `search_book` should use return values instead of printing results directly. This improves their reusability and allows the main function to decide how to handle each outcome.
   - *Suggestion*: Have `remove_book` return `True` or `False` based on whether the book was found and removed, and `search_book` return the book's details or `None` if not found.

2. **Case Insensitivity in Searches:**
   - Book searches are case-sensitive. Implement case-insensitivity to improve user-friendliness.
   - *Suggestion*: Convert titles to lowercase when comparing, as seen in the model solution.

3. **Collection Update on Book Addition:**
   - The `add_book` function doesn't return the updated collection, which might be confusing without consistent usage of returns across functions.
   - *Suggestion*: Although not strictly necessary here, returning the modified collection could match the `remove_book` return pattern, aiding future scalability.

4. **Boundary/Error Handling:**
   - It's good practice to handle potential errors gracefully, such as providing feedback when listing books if the collection is empty.
   - *Suggestion*: Add conditional checks in `list_books` to print a message if the collection is empty.

5. **Loop and Program Termination:**
   - While the use of `run` is effective for loop control, consider simplifying with a `break` statement for immediate loop termination when the exit option is selected.
   
### Final Thoughts:
Refining these aspects would bring it closer to a polished solution that adheres to both the problem requirements and good programming practices. Keep practicing modular coding and refining functions for reusability and reliability, which are essential skills in programming.","

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",8,"The student's code demonstrates a good understanding of the problem requirements, and the functions are mostly well-implemented. However, there are some functional suggestions and improvements that can enhance the clarity, error-handling capacity, and overall efficiency of the code:

### Suggestions:
1. **Return values in `add_book`:**
   - The `add_book` function should ideally return the updated collection to maintain consistency with the other functions. This promotes a more functional programming style and can be useful if the return value is used later in more complex programs.
   
   ```python
   def add_book(collection, title, author, year):
       book = {'title': title, 'author': author, 'year': year}
       collection.append(book)
       return collection
   ```

2. **Case Insensitivity:**
   - In `remove_book` and `search_book`, the title comparison should be case-insensitive to improve user experience (as implemented in the model solution).
   
   ```python
   if book['title'].lower() == title.lower():
   ```

3. **Handling Empty Collection in `list_books`:**
   - Before listing books, it's a good practice to check if the collection is empty and notify the user accordingly.
   
   ```python
   def list_books(collection):
       if not collection:
           print(""No books in the library."")
       else:
           for book in collection:
               print(f""{book['title']} by {book['author']}, {book['year']}"")
   ```

### Improvements in Clarity:
- **Comments:** Adding comments before each function to describe their purpose and parameters can improve code readability.

- **Main Menu Input Validation:** Error handling is correctly implemented for invalid menu choices. Consider improving error messages to be more user-friendly if other input validations are included, such as checking year format or empty strings for titles/authors.

Overall, the student has successfully captured the primary functionality of the Library Management System. The code is mostly functional, but with minor enhancements, it can achieve greater robustness and user-friendliness.","

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of function usage and modular programming but should pay attention to details specified in the requirements to fully meet all objectives.","
You are a computer science professor teaching introductory programming using Python.

Below is a problem description, an example solution, and a student's code. 
Use the rubric provided to evaluate the code and provide a score (1-10) and feedback. 
The score must be an integer in the range of 1 to 10.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

",8,"**Evaluation of Student's Code:**

Overall, the student's code performs the task well and complies with the main requirements of the problem statement. The student has effectively separated the system's functionality into functions, demonstrated good use of parameters and return values, and utilized appropriate data structures. However, there are some areas for improvement:

### **Strengths:**
1. **Modular Design:**
   - Functions are clearly defined for adding, removing, searching, and listing books.
   - Code is organized and easy to follow, with meaningful function and variable names.

2. **Correctness:**
   - Functions return the expected outputs.
   - Main menu functionality correctly handles user interactions and processes inputs.

3. **Clarity of Code:**
   - Docstrings clearly explain the purpose of each function.
   - Conditional logic in the main loop is straightforward.

### **Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Error Handling:**
   - There's limited error handling for invalid inputs such as non-integer values for the publication year. Consider implementing `try-except` blocks to catch such exceptions and prompt the user for a valid input.

2. **Duplication of Code:**
   - The design repeats some code, especially for printing actions in the `main` function. Consider creating a separate function for displaying messages which could make the code more maintainable.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The menu's ""exit"" option could be addressed with more informative feedback (e.g., ""System exiting, thank you!"").
   - Currently, the system is case-insensitive for book titles, which is good, but ensuring all user inputs are sanitized (like leading/trailing spaces removal) would improve performance.

### **Recommendations:**
- **Improve Error Handling:** Include basic input validation and more detailed error messages.
- **Enhance Code Maintenance:** Consider minimizing repetition by refactoring into smaller functions for common tasks.
- **Polish the User Experience:** Improve feedback for users especially when exiting or encountering invalid input.

With these improvements, the system would be robust, efficient, and even more user-friendly.","

You are a computer science professor teaching introductory programming using Python.

Below is a problem description, an example solution, and a student's code. 
Use the rubric provided to evaluate the code and provide a score (1-10) and feedback. 
The score must be an integer in the range of 1 to 10.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Library Management System

### Objective

You are tasked with developing a simple Library Management System using functions to demonstrate the principles of modular programming. The goal is to write reusable code that efficiently manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for books in the library. This exercise will help you understand the use of functions, parameters, return values, and variable scope.

### Problem Description

Your task is to implement a command-line based Library Management System in Python. The system should allow users to:

1. **Add a new book**: Add a book to the library collection with details such as title, author, and publication year.
2. **Remove a book**: Remove a book from the collection by its title.
3. **Search for a book**: Search for a book by title and display its details if found.
4. **List all books**: Display a list of all books currently in the library.

### Requirements

1. **Main Functionality**: 
    - Implement a main menu that allows users to select different operations.
    - Use functions to encapsulate each operation (add, remove, search, list).

2. **Functions**:
    - `add_book(collection, title, author, year)`: Adds a new book to the collection. Returns the updated collection.
    - `remove_book(collection, title)`: Removes a book by its title. Returns `True` if the book was removed successfully, or `False` if the book was not found.
    - `search_book(collection, title)`: Searches for a book by its title. Returns the book details if found, otherwise returns `None`.
    - `list_books(collection)`: Prints out all the books in the collection.

3. **Data Structure**:
    - Use a list of dictionaries to store books. Each book should be represented as a dictionary with keys: `title`, `author`, and `year`.

4. **User Input**:
    - Implement input handling in the main menu to interact with the user. Use appropriate prompts to navigate different operations.

5. **Scope and Reusability**:
    - Ensure variables are properly scoped. Global variables should be avoided unless necessary.
    - Functions should be reusable and handle errors gracefully.

6. **Return Values**:
    - Each function should return appropriate values based on its operation (e.g., updated collection, boolean status, book details).

### Example

Here is an example of how the system might work:


Welcome to the Library Management System
1. Add a new book
2. Remove a book
3. Search for a book
4. List all books
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1

Enter book title: The Great Gatsby
Enter author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Enter publication year: 1925
Book added successfully!

Choose an option: 4
Listing all books:
1. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925

Choose an option: 2
Enter book title to remove: The Great Gatsby
Book removed successfully!

Choose an option: 3
Enter book title to search: The Great Gatsby
Book not found.

Choose an option: 5
Goodbye!


### Constraints

- The system should be robust against invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer menu choices, searching for non-existent books).
- Assume a small number of books (e.g., less than 100) for simplicity.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of each function.
- Proper use of parameters and return values.
- Effective use of variable scope.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- User-friendly interaction and error handling.

By completing this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of functions and modular programming, essential skills for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

### Example Interaction

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

**Overall Functionality and Structure:**
The student's code correctly implements a basic structure for the library management system but misses some key requirements. While the provided model solution is a good reference, the student's code lacks some vital elements that significantly impact its functionality.

**Strengths:**
1. **Class Structure:** Defines `Book` and `Library` classes, following the required object-oriented approach.

2. **Basic Methods Present:** Contains essential methods for adding, removing, searching, and displaying books.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Book Object Usage:** 
   - The `Library` class should store `Book` objects. Currently, it only appends book titles to the `books` list, which skips using the `Book` class effectively.
   - To improve, update `addBook` to create and append `Book` objects.

2. **Error Handling for Removal:**
   - Removing a book should handle cases where the title does not exist gracefully, preventing errors when a non-existent book is attempted to be removed.
   - Add a check to ensure the book exists before attempting to remove it.

3. **Search and Display Functionality:**
   - The `searchBook` method should return and display detailed information (title, author, year) for the found book.
   - `displayBooks` should loop over `Book` objects and print each book's details.

4. **User Interaction (Menu):**
   - The `menu()` function is unfinished. Implementing a user interface to interact with the system is necessary for complete functionality.

**Comments and Justifications:**
- Comments explaining the choice of data structure and method functionalities are missing.
- Insight on why a list was chosen over an array and its implications on scaling should be documented.

**Additional Suggestions:**
- Review the example solution and attempt to incorporate the object-oriented principles demonstrated.
- Add validation for user inputs, ensuring incorrect inputs don't crash the program.

By addressing these areas, the system will align better with the task description and enhance its usability and responsibility to user inputs.","
Evaluate the student's code based on the problem description and the provided example solution.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",4,"**Feedback and Suggestions:**

1. **Data Structure Choice & Comments:**
   - The student used a list, which is appropriate for a dynamic collection. However, the student did not justify this choice in comments. It is important to document why a list was chosen over an array.

2. **Book Representation:**
   - The student is storing only the book titles as string objects in the list instead of complete `Book` objects. This limits functionality for accessing author and year information.
   - Suggestion: Store complete `Book` instances in the list.
   
3. **Implementation Details:**
   - **Add Book:** 
     - The function should create a `Book` object using the provided details and then append it to the list.
     - Suggestion: Use `self.books.append(Book(title, author, year))`.
   
   - **Remove Book:**
     - The function assumes a match if `title` is found in the list. But given the list should store `Book` objects, it's necessary to identify and remove a `Book` object based on attribute matching.
     - Suggestion: Iterate over the list, find the `Book` with the given title, and remove it.

  
   - **Search Book:**
     - Similar to remove, this method checks strings directly against a list of objects, making it inefficient for finding additional details.
     - Suggestion: Loop through the list and print details of the `Book` with a matching title.

4. **Display Books:**
   - The function currently only prints book titles, while it should print the full details of each `Book` object.
   - Suggestion: Use the `__str__()` method of the `Book` class to format the output.

5. **Menu Function and Main Method:**
   - The menu functionality is missing and needs implementation.
   - Suggestion: Implement a `main()` function like in the model solution to interact properly with the user.

6. **Error Handling**: 
   - Removing a book should handle scenarios where the book might not exist, using a try-except block to catch errors.
   
7. **Score Justification:**
   - The student shows understanding of object-oriented programming basics but failed to implement correct data handling for `Book` objects. The solution lacks completeness in functionality and error handling, thus earning a score of 4.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

",4,"### Re-evaluation of Student Submission

1. **Data Structure Choice and Justification (0 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: The student did not include any comments justifying the use of a list over an array.

2. **Add a Book Functionality (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: The function only adds the book's title and omits the author and year attributes. This diminishes its utility.

3. **Remove a Book Functionality (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: Although the function attempts to remove by title, it fails to handle the 'book not found' case.

4. **Search for a Book Functionality (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: It correctly checks for the title but does not access or display any book details.

5. **Display All Books Functionality (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: Outputs only the title, neglecting to show comprehensive book data.

6. **User Interaction and Menu System (0 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: This section remains unfinished, impacting how users interact with the application.

7. **Code Quality and Comments (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: The absence of comments in the code denotes insufficient explanation of logic.
   
8. **Handling of Assumptions and Constraints (0.5 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: No provisions for uniqueness of titles or maximum capacity constraints are present.

9. **Advantages and Limitations Discussion (0 points)**
   - **Reasoning**: There is no articulation of the pros and cons of using a list versus an array.

10. **Overall Functionality and Correctness (1 point)**
    - **Reasoning**: Limited implementation of the required functionality results in partial fulfillment.

### Justification for Modified Score

Taking into account the lack of a menu system, no data structure justification, and the incomplete description of book details, it is evident the functionality doesn’t align with expectations. Decreasing the score from 5 to 4 highlights critical gaps in implementing outlined requirements more effectively. Further revision addressing highlighted areas, incorporating class instances for books, and better structured user interaction would enhance the overall submission.

---

### Suggestions for Improvement
   - **Integrate Class Instances**: Employ instances of the `Book` class in the list to manage all relevant attributes efficiently.
   - **Expand Menu Implementation**: Implement a menu-driven system for better user engagement and interaction with the functions.
   - **Articulate Justification**: Provide rationale and insight into the selection of lists, enhancing comprehension of choices made.","

- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

",8,"### Evaluation of Student's Solution

The student has provided a good implementation of the basic structure necessary to manage a collection of books in a library using lists. Here is a detailed evaluation with suggestions for improvement:

### Strengths:
1. **Basic Structure Implemented:**
   - The solution defines the `Book` and `Library` classes, capturing the necessary attributes and functionalities.
2. **Main Menu Functions Correctly Implemented:**
   - The code provides a user interaction menu with correct logic for adding, removing, searching, and displaying books.
3. **Use of Lists:**
   - Correctly used Python lists to store book objects, utilizing their dynamic sizing properties, which fits with the problem statement and recommendations.

### Areas For Improvement:

1. **Type Checking:**
   - **Year** parameter in `addBook()` should be converted to an integer.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   library.addBook(title, author, int(year))
   ```
   This ensures that the year is consistently stored as an integer.

2. **Function Descriptions and Comments:**
   - Include comments explaining the purpose of each function and the choice of lists over arrays.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   # The Library class uses a list to store books due to its dynamic size, 
   # which is more flexible compared to a static array.
   ```

3. **Book Representation:**
   - Implement `__str__()` method in the `Book` class for a consistent and improved string representation.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   def __str__(self):
       return f""{self.title} by {self.author}, {self.year}""
   ```
   - This modification enhances readability and standardizes book printing across functions.

4. **Feedback Messages:**
   - Enhance user feedback messages for better clarity and user engagement. ""Book added"" can be ""Book added successfully"" for consistency.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Ensure that the title input is trimmed for whitespace to avoid accidental mismatches during book removal or search.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   ```python
   title = input(""Title:"").strip()
   ```

Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

   - Books are displayed with adequate formatting, fulfilling this component's requirement satisfactorily.

6. **User Interaction and Menu System (2 points):**
   - The menu system provides a seamless user interaction experience with no issues; thus, it receives full points.

7. **Code Quality and Comments (0.5 points):**
   - Although the code is structured, the lack of extensive comments reduces clarity, which justifies half the allocated point.

8. **Handling of Assumptions and Constraints (0.5 points):**
   - Assumptions about unique titles are handled, but lack of explicit constraint handling (e.g., collection size) necessitates a half-point deduction.

9. **Advantages and Limitations Discussion (0 points):**
   - There is no provided discussion on the comparison of lists versus arrays, leading to a zero score here.

10. **Overall Functionality and Correctness (0 points):**
    - Despite adequately addressing core functionality, missing specific edge case handling or improved comments would elevate functionality effectiveness, resulting in a score hold.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

#### **Correctness**
- **Add, Remove, Search Book**: All implemented methods function as intended, correctly manipulating the list of books.
- **Display Books**: Correctly displays all books if any exist.

#### **Code Structure**
- The class structure (`Book` and `Library`) is well-defined and similar to the model solution.
- The `main` function is implemented using a menu-driven approach, allowing seamless user interaction.

#### **Use of Data Structures**
- **List Usage**: A list is used to manage collections of books, aligning with the model solution and suitable for dynamic array manipulation.
  - **Justification Comment**: The student’s code lacks a comment justifying the choice of a list over an array, which is critical to understanding the rationale behind their data structure choice. This is crucial since part of the problem requirements explicitly asked for this explanation.

#### **User Interaction**
- The menu is intuitive and aligns well with the problem requirements.
- User feedback messages (e.g., `""Book added!""`, `""Book removed!""`) are concise and clear.

#### **Additional Comments**
- The code could benefit from more explanatory comments and the missing justification for choosing a list, strengthening the overall understanding.
- Consider using constant messages for uniformity and ease of maintenance, i.e., storing messages like `""Book added!""` in variables.

### **Conclusion**
The student's solution fulfills the main functional requirements, offering all necessary functionalities robustly. However, lack of justification comments and additional detailed explanations slightly detracts from the completeness of the solution.","
Evaluate the student's code based on the problem description and the provided example solution.

",8,"### Evaluation

The student code is well-structured and functional, employing a list as the data structure for managing the book collection. It closely mirrors the model solution in terms of functionality, offering a simple menu for user interaction. However, there are areas where improvements can be made for clarity and better practice:

### Feedback:

1. **Comments and Documentation:**
   - The student's code lacks comments, including the justification for choosing a list over an array. Adding comments can enhance understanding and justify design decisions.
   
2. **Function Prints:**
   - The function output messages can be more descriptive. For instance, ""Book added!"" could be ""The book titled '...' has been added successfully!""
   
3. **Code Consistency:**
   - While functionally similar to the model solution, minor changes in the phrasing of printed messages could be standardized for consistency across the code (e.g., ""Invalid choice.""). Standardizing these can promote a uniform user experience.
   
4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Consider enhancing `removeBook` and `searchBook` functions to handle cases with empty input strings or inputs with only spaces, which could prevent issues with unexpected behavior.
   
5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - While operation complexities are adequate given the problem scale, discussing list vs. array complexity could be useful. In the case of dynamic list sizes, a list is an appropriate choice; however, an understanding of performance implications is valuable.

### Suggested Improvements:

- **Add Comments:** Annotate the `Library` class initialization to explain the choice of a list.
- **Enhance User Messages:** Make output messages more uniform and informative across all operations.
- **Input Validation:** Implement checks for valid inputs to prevent empty string entries.
- **Menu Consistency:** Reflect the same wording format as the model solution for a polished finish.

### Score: 8/10

The student's submission successfully implements the required functionalities and adopts a sound data structure.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",8,"Overall, the student's implementation of the library management system is functional and closely aligns with the requirements. It is clear and well-structured, with all specified functionalities implemented. However, there are some areas for improvement:

1. **Comments and Justification of Data Structure Choice:** 
   - The student did not include comments or a justification for their choice of using a list over an array. Such explanations are crucial in demonstrating a deeper understanding of data structures and their applicability.
   - **Suggestion:** Add a comment in the `Library` class constructor explaining why a list is used (as it is dynamic and suitable for unknown collection sizes) instead of a fixed-size array.

2. **Consistency in Output Messages:**
   - The output messages for adding and removing books are slightly less descriptive compared to the model solution (e.g., ""Book added!"" vs. ""Book added successfully!""). While this is minor, uniform and informative messages enhance user experience.
   - **Suggestion:** Using more descriptive messages contributes to better user interaction.

3. **Refinement in Display Method:**
   - The `displayBooks` function does not print a summary heading when listing all books, which could provide more context when displaying.
   - **Suggestion:** Include a header like ""Displaying all books:"" in the `displayBooks` method for better clarity.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - There's minimal error checking on user inputs. While it may not be strictly necessary for this project, adding some input validation could reduce user input errors.
   - **Suggestion:** Implement basic input checks to ensure data integrity, such as verifying that year is a valid integer.

5. **Overall Structure:**
   - The student has adhered to good practices, making the code easy to follow and understand, with a logical flow and separation of responsibilities.

By addressing these points, the student's code would enhance both performance and user experience, making it more robust and polished. Given these considerations, the score of 8 reflects a solid understanding of Python programming with minor room for improvement in commenting and user interaction.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

### Example Interaction

- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

",8,"### Evaluation of the Student's Code

**General Overview:**
The student's code effectively addresses the problem requirements using a list as the chosen data structure, which is appropriate due to Python lists' dynamic sizing. The implementation mirrors the structure and functionality of the model solution, fulfilling the task requirements for adding, removing, searching, and displaying books.

**Detailed Evaluation:**
1. **Use of Data Structure:**
   - **Choice Justification:** The student chose a list, which is suitable and explained briefly in the comments. However, an explicit justification similar to the model solution would strengthen understanding.
   
2. **Functionality Implemented:**
   - **addBook:** Correctly adds a new `Book` object to the `books` list and prints success confirmation.
   - **removeBook:** Efficient search and appropriate removal logic are present. Book removal feedback is correctly printed.
   - **searchBook:** Implements an adequate search; correctly prints book details if found or notifies when not found.
   - **displayBooks:** Displays a list of books, or outputs an appropriate message when the collection is empty.
   
3. **User Interaction:**
   - The menu for user interaction is clear, and options are logically structured. The program accurately responds to user input for different functionalities.

4. **Code Comments and Documentation:**
   - While the code functions well, additional comments detailing the thought process behind using lists over arrays, as seen in the model solution, could benefit understanding.

5. **Efficiency and Maintainability:**
   - The code maintains simplicity and clarity. Each method is clearly defined and easily understandable, contributing to maintainability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Explicit Justification in Comments:** Add comments to explicitly justify why a list was chosen over an array. Discuss aspects like dynamic resizing and ease of use in string and object manipulation.
- **Edge Cases and Error Handling:** Consider adding checks for inputs, such as validating the year of publication to be an integer within a reasonable range. Consider cases where the user might enter a numerical year as a string, which could raise an exception.
- **Efficiency:** While current logic is adequate, the search and remove operations could be optimized using dictionary structures if scaling is a consideration, as they allow for faster operations.

### Conclusion:
The student’s implementation meets the specified requirements comprehensively, with only minor gaps in code justification and comments. With slight improvements, this code can achieve higher elegance and robustness.","

You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

",7,"Upon reevaluation, the student's code fulfills the main functional requirements of the library management system efficiently. However, it lacks certain key components required by the rubric, which justifies maintaining the earlier score of 7 out of 10:

1. **Data Structure Choice and Justification (0 points)**: The student did not provide a comment justifying their choice of using a list for the library collection. This element of the rubric necessitates a zero score in this category.

2. **Add a Book Functionality (1 point)**: The function `addBook` properly implements the addition of a book, aligning with the task requirements.

3. **Remove a Book Functionality (1 point)**: The `removeBook` function is correctly implemented, meaningfully handling cases where the book is not found.

4. **Search for a Book Functionality (1 point)**: This feature correctly searches and yields book details or a message if the book is absent.

5. **Display All Books Functionality (1 point)**: The function fulfills the requirement by listing all books effectively.

6. **User Interaction and Menu System (2 points)**: Comprehensive menu system integration secures full points in this section.

7. **Code Quality and Comments (0.5 points)**: Although the code is organized and mostly readable, the lack of specific comments regarding the choice of data structure is notable.

8. **Handling of Assumptions and Constraints (1 point)**: The code assumes book titles are unique as required; any maximum capacity constraint isn't applicable since a list is used instead of an array.

9. **Advantages and Limitations Discussion (0 points)**: Unfortunately, without a discussion comparing arrays and lists, this topic remains unaddressed.

10. **Overall Functionality and Correctness (1 point)**: The code runs as expected, meeting the primary requirements.

While the student's programming competency is clear, an incomplete alignment with the rubric (particularly contextual comments and discussion) understandably sets their score at 7.","

Problem Description:
## Problem Statement: Manage a Library Collection Using Arrays and Lists

### Background
In this exercise, you will explore the use of arrays and lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science for storing collections of elements. Arrays and lists allow you to store multiple items of the same type, access them efficiently, and perform various operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### Problem Description
You have been tasked with developing a simple library management system to keep track of books in a small library. Each book in the library is characterized by the following attributes:

- **Title** (a string)
- **Author** (a string)
- **Year of Publication** (an integer)

Your task is to implement a program that manages the library collection using either an array or a list. The program should provide the following functionalities:

1. **Add a book** to the collection.
2. **Remove a book** from the collection by title.
3. **Search for a book** by title and display its details.
4. **Display all books** currently in the collection.

### Requirements
1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use either an array or a list to store the collection of books. Justify your choice in comments within your code.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Add a Book**: Implement a function `addBook(title, author, year)` that adds a new book with the given title, author, and year to the collection.
   - **Remove a Book**: Implement a function `removeBook(title)` that removes the book with the specified title from the collection. If the book is not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Search for a Book**: Implement a function `searchBook(title)` that searches for a book by its title and prints its details if found. If not found, print an appropriate message.
   - **Display All Books**: Implement a function `displayBooks()` that prints the details of all books currently in the collection.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program should allow users to interact with it through a simple text-based menu. Users should be able to choose operations such as adding, removing, searching for, and displaying books.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - You can assume that book titles are unique within the collection.
   - You can store a maximum of 100 books in the array if using an array.

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",9,"### Evaluation of Student Code

The student's provided code comprehensively adheres to the problem requirements. Here's a detailed analysis, along with suggestions for potential enhancements:

#### Strengths:
1. **Modular Structure:** 
   - Divided into coherent functions (`get_student_data`, `write_to_file`, `read_from_file_and_display`, and `main`) that effectively separate different aspects of the program, making it maintainable and easy to understand.

2. **Error Handling:** 
   - Includes error handling for both invalid grade inputs (via `try-except` for `ValueError`) and file I/O operations (`IOError`). This demonstrates good foresight in anticipating and managing user input errors and file issues.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Appropriately checks that the grade entered is within the specified range of 0 to 100, ensuring data integrity.

4. **Informative Output:**
   - Properly formats and labels the data when displaying it to the console, enhancing readability.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Input Validation Message Consistency:**
   - Consider adding a consistent error message for cases where the input for the number of students is not an integer. This would enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback for erroneous inputs.
""# Example Addition:
```
while True:
    try:
        num_students = int(input(""Enter the number of students: ""))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print(""Invalid input. Please enter a numerical value for the number of students."")
```

2. **Code Comments:**
   - While the code is clean and the function names are descriptive, adding comments explaining complex or less obvious parts of the code would further improve readability and serve as a learning aid for others reviewing the code.

3. **Use of More Specific Exceptions:**
   - Consider using `FileNotFoundError` for more specificity instead of the general `IOError`, especially if anticipating specific file-related issues. However, this is more of a best-practice suggestion and does not affect correctness.

#### Conclusion:
Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the problem requirements and successfully implemented a solution that is both effective and efficient. With minor improvements in user interaction and documentation, the solution would be exemplary in clarity and robustness.","

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

Rubric:
Creating a grading rubric for the ""Simple Student Grade Tracker"" project involves breaking down the requirements into specific, measurable criteria. Here's a 10-point rubric that aligns with the problem statement and expected learning outcomes:

1. **Console Input Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program correctly prompts the user for the number of students and iteratively collects each student's name and grade. It validates that grades are numerical and within the range of 0 to 100.
   - **1 point:** The program collects input but has minor issues, such as not validating the grade range or not handling non-numeric input gracefully.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to collect input correctly or does not validate input at all.

2. **File Writing (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program successfully writes the student names and grades to `student_grades.txt` in the correct format (name, grade).
   - **0 points:** The program fails to write the data to the file or writes it in an incorrect format.

3. **File Reading (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program reads the data from `student_grades.txt` correctly and prepares it for display.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to read the data from the file or encounters errors that prevent reading.

4. **Console Output Formatting (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program displays the data in a neatly formatted table with clear column headers for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - **1 point:** The program displays the data but with minor formatting issues, such as misaligned columns or missing headers.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to display the data in a readable format.

5. **Error Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program includes robust error handling for both user input and file I/O operations, providing clear error messages and guidance to the user.
   - **1 point:** The program includes some error handling but may miss certain edge cases or provide unclear error messages.
   - **0 points:** The program lacks error handling, leading to crashes or undefined behavior in case of invalid input or file errors.

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program follows a logical flow, guiding the user through the input, saving, and displaying processes with clear messages.
   - **0 points:** The program's flow is confusing or lacks sufficient user guidance, making it difficult to use.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program is well-structured, with functions used to separate different tasks (e.g., input collection, file writing, file reading, and display).
   - **0 points:** The program lacks modularity, with all logic contained in a single block of code, making it difficult to read and maintain.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is clean and readable, with appropriate comments explaining the functionality of different sections.
   - **0 points:** The code is difficult to read due to poor formatting or lacks comments, making it hard to understand the logic.

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**

"
problem7_statement,problem7-0pt.txt,3,"The student's code is a very basic implementation that lacks several key features required by the problem description. Below are the specific areas where improvements are needed:

### Missing Features:
1. **Number of Students Input:**
   - The program should prompt the user to enter the number of students, and then iterate through the input for each student. Currently, it only asks for one student's name and grade, regardless of the number of students.
   
2. **Validation and Error Handling:**
   - There's no validation to ensure that the grade entered is between 0 and 100, nor is there error handling for non-numeric input.

3. **Formatted Output:**
   - The output format is not in the form of a table as requested in the problem statement. The student data from the file should be displayed in a neatly formatted table.
   
4. **Functions:**
   - The code should be structured using functions to separate concerns and improve readability and maintainability. As it stands, all the code is in the global scope.

5. **Guidance for User:**
   - The program doesn't provide messages guiding the user through the input process or indicating when data has been successfully saved or read, apart from printing file contents directly.

### Recommended Improvements:
- Implement a loop to gather input for the specified number of students.
- Validate the grade input to ensure it is numeric and within range.
- Use functions to organize code for gathering input, writing to a file, and reading/displaying data.
- Format the output when reading from the file to match the example provided in the problem.
- Add print statements to guide the user through each step of the process and handle any errors such as file I/O issues.

### Conclusion:
To align with the problem requirements, the student should take an iterative approach to handle multiple students, include proper input validation and error handling, and structure their code into functions for better clarity and purpose separation. This will improve the code's robustness and make it easier to maintain and extend in the future.","

",4,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

**Strengths:**
- Basic structure for reading and writing data to a file is present.
- The use of `input()` to gather data and `open()` for file operations is correctly implemented.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Functional Completeness:**
   - The code currently handles only a single student's name and grade. The requirement is to handle input for multiple students. The current implementation does not prompt for the number of students nor iterate based on this input.

2. **Grade Validation:**
   - The student's code does not validate whether the grade is a numerical value between 0 to 100. Implementing a `try-except` block coupled with a condition check is necessary to ensure valid input.

3. **Program Structure:**
   - Using functions for different tasks promotes code readability, reuse, and maintainability. Consider breaking down the task into smaller functions, such as `get_student_data`, `write_to_file`, and `read_from_file_and_display`.

4. **File Reading and Formatting Output:**
   - The output from the file should be displayed in a formatted table with ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"" headers to emulate the model solution.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Include exception handling for file I/O operations to ensure robust performance even in the event of file access issues.

### Suggested Code Improvements

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

Rubric:
Creating a grading rubric for the ""Simple Student Grade Tracker"" project involves breaking down the requirements into specific, measurable criteria. Here's a 10-point rubric that aligns with the problem statement and expected learning outcomes:

1. **Console Input Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program correctly prompts the user for the number of students and iteratively collects each student's name and grade. It validates that grades are numerical and within the range of 0 to 100.
   - **1 point:** The program collects input but has minor issues, such as not validating the grade range or not handling non-numeric input gracefully.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to collect input correctly or does not validate input at all.

2. **File Writing (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program successfully writes the student names and grades to `student_grades.txt` in the correct format (name, grade).
   - **0 points:** The program fails to write the data to the file or writes it in an incorrect format.

3. **File Reading (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program reads the data from `student_grades.txt` correctly and prepares it for display.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to read the data from the file or encounters errors that prevent reading.

4. **Console Output Formatting (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program displays the data in a neatly formatted table with clear column headers for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - **1 point:** The program displays the data but with minor formatting issues, such as misaligned columns or missing headers.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to display the data in a readable format.

5. **Error Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program includes robust error handling for both user input and file I/O operations, providing clear error messages and guidance to the user.
   - **1 point:** The program includes some error handling but may miss certain edge cases or provide unclear error messages.
   - **0 points:** The program lacks error handling, leading to crashes or undefined behavior in case of invalid input or file errors.

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program follows a logical flow, guiding the user through the input, saving, and displaying processes with clear messages.
   - **0 points:** The program's flow is confusing or lacks sufficient user guidance, making it difficult to use.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program is well-structured, with functions used to separate different tasks (e.g., input collection, file writing, file reading, and display).
   - **0 points:** The program lacks modularity, with all logic contained in a single block of code, making it difficult to read and maintain.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is clean and readable, with appropriate comments explaining the functionality of different sections.
   - **0 points:** The code is difficult to read due to poor formatting or lacks comments, making it hard to understand the logic.

This rubric provides a clear and structured way to evaluate the project, ensuring that all key aspects of the problem statement are addressed and that students are encouraged to write clean, functional, and user-friendly code.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",3,"Upon reevaluating the student's code, it becomes evident that the fundamental elements of the problem statement were overlooked or underdeveloped. 

- **Console Input Handling (0 points):**
  - The program does not prompt for multiple students and fails in grade validation, which are key requirements.

- **File Writing (1 point):**
  - The code correctly writes to the file, capturing the student's details in the designated format.

- **File Reading (1 point):**
  - It meets the criteria for reading data back from the file, although printing could be more structured.

- **Console Output Formatting (0 points):**
  - Lacks the tabular format with headers, which is crucial for clear data presentation.

- **Error Handling (0 points):**
  - Without any form of error handling, the program is vulnerable to crashes, especially with invalid user input or file I/O issues.

- **Program Flow and User Guidance (0 points):**
  - There is no clear program flow; logical steps like prompting for the number of students and iterating aren't addressed.

- **Code Structure and Modularity (0 points):**
  - The absence of functions or other modular components contributes to poor code structure.

- **Code Readability and Comments (1 point):**
  - While the code is straightforward, the absence of comments limits its readability.

Considering these factors, the student's work only reaches a basic level of functionality in reading/writing operations while missing out on core structure, error checking, and presentation tasks. Thus, it warrants a score decrease to highlight needed improvements beyond basic functionality.","

Previous Feedback:
**Evaluation Criteria and Scoring:**

1. **Console Input Handling (0 points):**
   - The program doesn't prompt for the number of students and only asks for one student's details without validating grade input. Hence, it lacks the ability to handle multiple entries and doesn't validate grade range.

2. **File Writing (1 point):**
   - The code successfully writes the student's name and grade to `student_grades.txt` in the correct format (name, grade), fulfilling this requirement.

3. **File Reading (1 point):**
   - The program reads from the file and prints each line of data, achieving the basic requirement to read the file data.

4. **Console Output Formatting (0 points):**
   - The output is not formatted in a table with headers. It simply prints lines, missing a structured, user-friendly display.

5. **Error Handling (0 points):**
   - No error handling is implemented for file I/O or user input, which could lead to failures and unhandled exceptions.

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1 point):**
   - While basic guidance is provided for inputting a single student, the overall flow for multiple entries is absent.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (0 points):**
   - The code is not broken into functions or modules, leading to a lack of clear separation between logic parts.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (1 point):**
   - The code structure is simple and readable given its size, but it lacks comments.

**Overall Comments:**

- **Strengths:** The program successfully writes and reads data from a file in the expected format.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Implement input validation, multiple student entries, a structured display format, error handling, and breaking down the code into functions for better modularity and readability. Adding comments would also enhance understandability.

The student's code effectively collects student names and grades, writes them to a file, and reads from the file to display the data. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made for better functionality and user experience:

1. **Validation:**
   - **Grade Input Validation:**
     - The student's code lacks input validation for grades. It does not ensure that grades are numerical values within the range of 0 to 100. Incorporating validation like the example solution would prevent invalid data entry.
   - **Numeric Input for Number of Students:**
     - While `int(num_students)` is used, input validation should ensure that `num_students` is a positive integer. This could prevent runtime errors when invalid input is given.

2. **Formatted Output:**
   - 
     - The output lacks the structured table format seen in the example solution. Adding headers for 'Student Name' and 'Grade' with a formatted table would improve readability and user experience.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - 
     - The student's solution does not handle potential file I/O errors. Incorporating try-except blocks around file reading and writing operations is crucial to handle exceptions gracefully and inform the user of any issues, like the example solution.

4. **User Guidance:**
   - 
     - Providing messages to guide the user through each step of the program is beneficial. For instance, after each operation (file write/read), a statement confirming the success or failure of the operation, like ""Data saved to student_grades.txt."", can be helpful.

5. **Code Documentation:**
   - 
     - Improving code readability with comments explaining the purpose of each function and critical sections can greatly enhance understandability and maintainability for future reference.

**Conclusion:**

The student's code achieves the project's main goals, but implementing missing input validation, error handling, formatted output, and user guidance would enhance the program's robustness and user experience.","
Evaluate the student's code based on the problem description and the provided example solution.

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

",6,"### Feedback on the Student's Code:

The student's code effectively addresses the primary goal of collecting student names and grades, writing these to a file, and reading/displaying the content. However, there are several areas for improvement to align closer with best practices and ensure the program's robustness.

#### 1. **Input Validation:**
   - **Grade Validation:** There is no mechanism to validate the grade input to ensure it's a numerical value and falls within the 0 to 100 range. Without this, invalid grades (like ""A"" or ""101"") can be stored, leading to incorrect data.
   - **Input Type Conversion:** While converting `num_students` to an integer, direct conversion without validation might lead to runtime errors for non-numeric inputs.
   
   **Suggestions:**
   - Implement a `try-except` block to handle non-numeric inputs for both grades and the number of students.
   - Use a `while` loop to ensure the grade entered is within the specified range.

#### 2. **File I/O Exception Handling:**
   - There is no handling for potential I/O errors when writing to or reading from the file, such as file access issues.
   
   **Suggestions:**
   - Wrap file operations in `try-except` blocks to catch and respond to `IOError` exceptions.
   
#### 3. **Console Output Formatting:**
   - The current display for reading from the file isn't formatted neatly as specified in the problem statement.
   
   **Suggestion:**
   - Add string formatting (such as using `f-string` alignment or `formatstrings`) to create a table-like output for better readability.

#### 4. **Functionality and Readability:**
   - Minor improvements can be made, such as adding comments to explain parts of your code.
   
   **Suggestions:**
   - Comment sections of code explaining what each part does.
   - Revise variable naming if needed to enhance understanding (though ""students"", ""filename"" are already quite clear).

### Overall:
The student has implemented a basic solution that captures the essence of the problem but lacks important validation and error handling, negatively impacting the robustness and user experience of the application. Addressing these issues will improve functionality significantly.","

   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

Rubric:
Creating a grading rubric for the ""Simple Student Grade Tracker"" project involves breaking down the requirements into specific, measurable criteria. Here's a 10-point rubric that aligns with the problem statement and expected learning outcomes:

1. **Console Input Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program correctly prompts the user for the number of students and iteratively collects each student's name and grade. It validates that grades are numerical and within the range of 0 to 100.
   - **1 point:** The program collects input but has minor issues, such as not validating the grade range or not handling non-numeric input gracefully.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to collect input correctly or does not validate input at all.

2. **File Writing (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program successfully writes the student names and grades to `student_grades.txt` in the correct format (name, grade).
   - **0 points:** The program fails to write the data to the file or writes it in an incorrect format.

3. **File Reading (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program reads the data from `student_grades.txt` correctly and prepares it for display.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to read the data from the file or encounters errors that prevent reading.

4. **Console Output Formatting (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program displays the data in a neatly formatted table with clear column headers for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - **1 point:** The program displays the data but with minor formatting issues, such as misaligned columns or missing headers.
   - **0 points:** The program fails to display the data in a readable format.

5. **Error Handling (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The program includes robust error handling for both user input and file I/O operations, providing clear error messages and guidance to the user.
   - **1 point:** The program includes some error handling but may miss certain edge cases or provide unclear error messages.
   - **0 points:** The program lacks error handling, leading to crashes or undefined behavior in case of invalid input or file errors.

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program follows a logical flow, guiding the user through the input, saving, and displaying processes with clear messages.
   - **0 points:** The program's flow is confusing or lacks sufficient user guidance, making it difficult to use.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The program is well-structured, with functions used to separate different tasks (e.g., input collection, file writing, file reading, and display).
   - **0 points:** The program lacks modularity, with all logic contained in a single block of code, making it difficult to read and maintain.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is clean and readable, with appropriate comments explaining the functionality of different sections.
   - **0 points:** The code is difficult to read due to poor formatting or lacks comments, making it hard to understand the logic.

This rubric provides a clear and structured way to evaluate the project, ensuring that all key aspects of the problem statement are addressed and that students are encouraged to write clean, functional, and user-friendly code.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",6,"Upon reevaluating the student's code in light of the feedback and rubric, there are areas that merit reconsideration:

1. **Console Input Handling (1/2 points):**
   The student collects input without grade validation, but input collection happens successfully. No additional points are awarded here due to lack of validation, as recognized previously.

2. **File Writing (1/1 points):**
   Data is written correctly, consistent with both the rubric and original assessment.

3. **File Reading (1/1 points):**
   Succesful reading and printing of the file content. Agreed with initial scoring.

4. **Console Output Formatting (1/2 points):**
   The output lacks a table format but successfully displays data. Revisiting this, displaying lines suggests a minimum level of output capability, warranting 1 point.

5. **Error Handling (0/2 points):**
   Known absence of error-handling, the initial score stands. 

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1/1 points):**
   Logical flow is present, which coincides with the original evaluation.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (1/1 points):**
   Good function use for modularity, aligning with original review.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (0/1 points):**
   Lack of comments impacts readability and aligns with earlier evaluation.

An increase from 5 to 6/10 is justified primarily by the realization that the student does provide some unformatted but readable output, which suggests a basic capability in console output formatting, justifying a score increase.","

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**

Previous Score: 5

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
"
problem7_statement,problem7-4pt.txt,7,"### Evaluation Summary:

The student's code generally meets the problem requirements but lacks some critical elements necessary for robustness and proper functionality. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Strengths:
1. **Basic Structure & Flow:**
   - The code is structured into separate functions, improving readability and modularity.
   - Follows a logical flow similar to the example solution, capturing input, writing to a file, and reading from a file.

2. **File Handling:**
   - Uses a try-except block to catch errors during file writing and reading, which is a good practice in terms of error handling.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - Similar to the sample solution, outputs a well-structured table displaying student data.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Input Validation:**
   - **Missing:** There is no validation to check the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100. This can lead to incorrect data being written to the file.
   - **Improvement:** Implement input validation with appropriate feedback messages, as shown in the example solution.

2. **Error Handling Specificity:**
   - **Missing:** Does not specify the type of exception in the except block for file operations. As a result, potential debugging and future modifications might be affected due to generic error messages.
   - **Improvement:** Specify exceptions like `IOError` for file operations to give precise error feedback.

3. **Data Type Consistency:**
   - **Issue:** Grades are treated as strings when appending student data. This could cause issues when performing numerical operations.
   - **Improvement:** Convert grades to float or int upon input to ensure that numerical data handling, like sorting or calculations, is possible if needed in the future.

4. **Code Comments and Documentation:**
   - **Missing:** Code lacks comments explaining the logic behind sections, which can cause difficulties in maintenance and understanding for others.
   - **Improvement:** Add meaningful comments to describe the intent and functionality of various code sections.

### Overall Score: **7/10**

The student's code meets several fundamental requirements of the task, with good use of functions and structured output. However, it falls short in input validation, exception handling specificity, and lacks explanation through comments. Addressing these points would significantly improve the program's robustness and clarity.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"The student's code is functional in terms of collecting student data, storing it in a file, and displaying the saved data in a table format. However, a few improvements are needed to ensure robustness, readability, and adherence to best practices. Let's break down the feedback and suggestions:

### Feedback and Suggestions

1. **Input Validation for Grades**:
   - **Issue**: The student's code does not currently validate the grade input to ensure it is a number between 0 and 100, which could lead to invalid data.
   - **Suggestion**: Implement a loop with a try-except block as done in the model solution to ensure input validity.
     ```python
     while True:
         try:
             grade = float(input(f""Enter student {i + 1} grade: ""))
             if 0 <= grade <= 100:
                 break
             else:
                 print(""Grade must be between 0 and 100. Please try again."")
         except ValueError:
             print(""Invalid input. Please enter a numerical value for the grade."")
     students.append((name, grade))
     ```

2. **Error Handling for File I/O**:
   - **Issue**: The student uses bare except clauses, which can obscure different types of errors and make debugging challenging.
   - **Suggestion**: Catch specific exceptions (like `IOError`) and provide detailed error messages.
     ```python
     except IOError as e:
         print(f""An error occurred while writing to the file: {e}"")
     ```

3. **Code Readability and Maintenance**:
   - **Issue**: Code could benefit from additional comments explaining key sections, which helps with understanding and maintenance.
   - **Suggestion**: Add comments to describe the purpose of each function, key blocks of code, and important decisions.

4. **Overall Structure and Design**:
   - **Issue**: While the student’s code performs the required operations, it does not utilize a structured approach to handle potential exceptions thoroughly. Improving error messages and handling enhances usability.
   - **Suggestion**: Consider implementing helper functions or using a class to encapsulate the functionality if the project scales.

### Conclusion:
- **Score Rationale**: While the student has demonstrated a good grasp of file I/O and basic program construction, the lack of input validation and basic error handling has significant implications on the program's robustness, which affects the overall score. Enhancing these aspects will elevate the solution to a higher standard. The suggested score reflects the areas for improvement while acknowledging the functional implementation provided. 

With these refinements, the student's code would be more robust and aligned with best practices in programming.","

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

",7,"### Evaluation of Student Code:

1. **Console Input Handling: 0 points**
   - The program correctly prompts the user for input but lacks validation for grades being within the range of 0 to 100. Additionally, no checks ensure grade input is numeric, which could lead to runtime errors.
   
2. **File Writing: 1 point**
   - The program writes student data to the file successfully and in the correct format.
   
3. **File Reading: 1 point**
   - The program reads the data from the file and prepares it for display without issues.
   
4. **Console Output Formatting: 2 points**
   - The program displays data in a neatly formatted table, with clear column headers and data alignment perfectly implemented.
   
5. **Error Handling: 0 points**
   - The student code lacks specific error handling for user input and uses bare exceptions for file I/O, which can mask potential errors. This can lead to user confusion or program crashes.
   
6. **Program Flow and User Guidance: 1 point**
   - The program follows a logical flow, moving from data input to file writing, and finally to reading and displaying data. Guided messages assist the user well throughout the program.
   
7. **Code Structure and Modularity: 1 point**
   - The student has structured the program well, segregating tasks into functions for input, file operations, and display, ensuring easier maintenance and readability.
   
8. **Code Readability and Comments: 1 point**
   - The code is clean and fairly easy to read, although comments could enhance understanding further by explaining specific logic and error handling mechanisms.

### Recommendations for Improvement:
- **Validation & Error Handling:** Implement input validation to ensure grades are numbers within 0 to 100, and handle invalid input gracefully.
- **Error Handling for I/O:** Avoid bare exception clauses; specify exceptions to catch specific I/O errors and guide the user properly.

Previous Feedback:
### Evaluation of Student Code:

1. **Console Input Handling: 0 points**
   - The program correctly prompts the user for input but lacks validation for grades being within the range of 0 to 100. Additionally, no checks ensure grade input is numeric, which could lead to runtime errors.
   
2. **File Writing: 1 point**
   - The program writes student data to the file successfully and in the correct format.
   
3. **File Reading: 1 point**
   - The program reads the data from the file and prepares it for display without issues.
   
4. **Console Output Formatting: 2 points**
   - The program displays data in a neatly formatted table, with clear column headers and data alignment perfectly implemented.
   
5. **Error Handling: 0 points**
   - The student code lacks specific error handling for user input and uses bare exceptions for file I/O, which can mask potential errors. This can lead to user confusion or program crashes.
   
6. **Program Flow and User Guidance: 1 point**
   - The program follows a logical flow, moving from data input to file writing, and finally to reading and displaying data. Guided messages assist the user well throughout the program.

"
problem7_statement,problem7-6pt.txt,8,"The student's code effectively meets the core requirements of the problem statement but has room for improvement in error handling and code structure. 

### Strengths:
1. **Basic Structure & Flow:**
   - The code is well-organized with functions for task segregation: `get_student_data`, `write_to_file`, and `read_from_file_and_display`.
   - The main program flow mirrors the instructions, ensuring that data is collected, saved, and displayed correctly. 

2. **File I/O:**
   - Data writing and reading from `student_grades.txt` work as intended without any reported errors. 

3. **Console Output:**
   - Table formatting is neat, providing clarity in the display of student data. 

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Error Handling:**
   - While errors in numerical input for grades are handled, automatically defaulting to a grade of 0 isn't the best user experience.
   - Prompt users to re-enter the grade for invalid inputs rather than defaulting to 0, as seen in the model solution. 

2. **Code Efficiency & Cleanliness:**
   - Try-except blocks should only cover input conversion sections, not the entire input process. 
   - Consider using a separate function for grade validation to reduce redundancy. 

3. **User Guidance:**
   - More informative user prompt messages would improve usability, especially when informing users about incorrect input. 

4. **Comments and Documentation:**
   - While the code is mostly readable, adding comments would help with code maintainability and understanding, especially in functions handling critical operations like file I/O. 

### Conclusion:
The solution is functional and well-organized but can benefit from enhanced user interaction and improved error handling strategies. Improving these aspects will lead to higher scores and a more user-friendly experience.","

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

",7,"### Evaluation of the Student's Code

The student's implementation of the Simple Student Grade Tracker meets several key objectives but also has some areas that can be refined. Let's break down the evaluation in detail:

### Code Review

1. **Handling Student Data**
   - The code efficiently captures input for the number of students and requests student names and grades correctly.
   - Validation checks for grade values are implemented, but improvements could enhance reliability and user experience.
     - **Suggestion:** Prompt the user to re-enter a valid grade instead of defaulting to 0 if an invalid grade is entered. This ensures accuracy in user input.

2. **Error Handling**
   - The student provides basic error handling for invalid grade inputs through the use of a `try-except` block.
   - **Improvement:** It's better to loop back and prompt the user again rather than setting the grade to 0 if the input is invalid.

3. **File I/O Operations**
   - File writing and reading are correctly handled using Python's context manager (`with` statement).
   - **Error Handling:** The code should include try-except blocks to catch any potential I/O errors. This is missing and can lead to unhandled exceptions if file operations fail.

4. **Data Display**
   - The program successfully formats the output from the file, displaying it in a neat table format.

5. **Structuring and Modularity**
   - The code is modular, with distinct functions for different tasks (`get_student_data`, `write_to_file`, `read_from_file_and_display`).
   - **Enhancement:** Further breakdown of functionality (e.g., dedicated function for grade validation) could enhance maintainability.

6. **User Interaction**
   - The sequence of input, data storage, and data display is logically structured, providing a good flow for users.
   - However, handling incorrect inputs and teaching students robust error management techniques would improve robustness.

### Final Thoughts

The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of basic programming concepts, including input handling, file I/O, and output formatting. However, there is room for improvement in handling user input errors and potential file I/O errors more robustly.

### Scoring
**Score: 7/10**

While this implementation meets the core requirements well, it would greatly benefit from improved error handling strategies and a more user-friendly approach to input validation. Through these enhancements, the code would become more resilient and user-centric.","

Below is a problem description, an example solution, and a student's code. 
Use the rubric provided to evaluate the code and provide a score (1-10) and feedback. 
The score must be an integer in the range of 1 to 10.

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

",9,"Upon reevaluating the student's code, here's why the score has been adjusted to 9:

1. **Console Input Handling (2/2):** The student's code efficiently handles input validation, ensuring numerical grades and appropriately assigning defaults when input errors occur.
   
2. **File Writing (1/1):** Data is correctly formatted and written to the file as expected.

3. **File Reading (1/1):** The reading from the file functionality works without errors, successfully retrieving and preparing data for display.

4. **Console Output Formatting (2/2):** The student's output formatting is clear and matches the expected structure with defined headers and aligned columns.

5. **Error Handling (1/2):** While basic error handling is present, there is a notable absence of file I/O error handling, which could lead to issues if file access encounters errors.

6. **Program Flow and User Guidance (1/1):** The logical flow of the program improves user interaction, making the program intuitive to use.

7. **Code Structure and Modularity (1/1):** Effective use of functions ensures organized, modular code that separates concerns and maintains readability.

8. **Code Readability and Comments (0/1):** Although the student code efficiently meets requirements, it lacks comments explaining the structure and logic, making it difficult for others to follow without additional context.

"
problem7_statement,problem7-8pt.txt,8,"The student's code successfully implements most of the functionality outlined in the problem description. Here is an evaluation of different aspects of the code:

### Strengths:
- **Basic Structure**: The student has structurally organized their code into functions, which makes it modular and easy to follow.
- **Input Handling**: The student sanitizes input by checking if the grade is a digit and within a valid range, providing user prompts accordingly.
- **File I/O**: The `write_to_file` function correctly writes the formatted data to a specified file and confirms the action.
- **Reading and Displaying Data**: The code correctly reads from the file and presents the data in a tabulated format that aligns reasonably well.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Error Handling**:
   - While there is a bare minimum exception handling when opening files to read, it lacks detailed handling for file writing errors.
   - Should handle more specific errors like FileNotFoundError or PermissionError more explicitly in file operations.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - The error handling for the number of students could be improved. Currently, it defaults to 1 without notifying the user. It's better to prompt the user again for correct input.

3. **Formatting**:
   - The console table's formatting slightly differs from the example (e.g., column widths). Adjusting the table width for consistency with requirements would be beneficial.

4. **Data Types**:
   - While grade validation checks if it is a digit, converting the input to an integer post-validation is crucial to prevent unintended formats.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Code could benefit from more inline comments for clarity, especially within loops and conditionals, to guide someone unfamiliar with the code.

Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of basic programming concepts and file I/O operations with room for refinement in error handling and formatting consistency.""","

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.

------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

",7,"### Evaluation of the Student's Code

The student's code successfully meets most of the problem statement requirements. Here's a detailed analysis with functional suggestions for improvement:

#### Strengths:
1. **Basic Structure and Functionality**
   - The code correctly collects user input and writes it to a file.
   - It reads from the `student_grades.txt` file and displays the data as required.
   - Proper use of functions to organize code into logical sections.

2. **Input Validation**
   - Good use of `isdigit()` for numerical grade validation, ensuring grades are within the range 0-100.
   
3. **Error Handling**
   - Efficient handling of conversion for `num_students` with a default assumption, avoiding a program crash.

4. **Informative Console Outputs**
   - Provides clear messaging for each step, which enhances user experience.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Exception Handling:**
   - Currently, the program falls back to 1 student on non-integer input. It would be better to prompt the user to re-enter the input until a valid integer is provided.
   - Include exception handling for file writing in `write_to_file()` to inform the user of potential I/O errors.

2. **Formatting Improvements:**
   - The width of tables in the `read_from_file_and_display()` function is slightly off ([12] for name, [5] for grade). Adjust these values for look and consistency:
     ```python
     print(""| {name:<15} | {grade:<7} |"")
     ```

3. **Data Type Consistency:**
   - Consider storing grades directly as floats instead of casting them as integers. Even though the requirement states integers are within range, clarity can be improved by using floats to facilitate future upgrades (e.g., grading on a curve).

4. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Adding more inline comments or docstrings would enhance the code's readability and help others understand the functionality of sections at-a-glance.

#### Overall Feedback:
The student's solution adheres closely to the requirements with minor formatting and error handling improvements needed. The code is highly readable, making a solid foundation for real-world applications. With a few refinements, it would be fully aligned with a professional standard.","

Problem Description:
**Problem Statement: Simple Student Grade Tracker**

**Objective:**
Create a simple console-based program that allows a user (a teacher) to input student names and their grades, store this data in a file, and then read from the file to display the stored data in a formatted manner.

**Requirements:**

1. **Console Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
   - For each student, ask the user to input the student's name and grade. Assume the grade is a numerical value between 0 and 100.

2. **File I/O:**
   - Store the student names and their corresponding grades in a text file called `student_grades.txt`. Each line in the file should contain one student's name followed by their grade, separated by a comma (e.g., `John Doe, 85`).

3. **Console Output:**
   - After saving the data, read the contents of `student_grades.txt` and display the data in a formatted table with columns for ""Student Name"" and ""Grade"".
   - Ensure the data is displayed in a neat, easy-to-read format.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate user input to ensure that grades are within the valid range (0 to 100).
   - Handle any potential file I/O errors (e.g., if the file cannot be created or read).

5. **Program Flow:**
   - The program should first collect the input data and write it to the file.
   - After writing the data, it should read from the file and display the output.
   - Provide appropriate messages to guide the user through the input process and inform them of any errors that occur.

**Example Execution:**


Enter the number of students: 3

Enter student 1 name: Alice Smith
Enter student 1 grade: 92

Enter student 2 name: Bob Johnson
Enter student 2 grade: 85

Enter student 3 name: Charlie Brown
Enter student 3 grade: 78

Data saved to student_grades.txt.
Reading from file and displaying data:

------------------------------
| Student Name     | Grade   |
------------------------------
| Alice Smith      | 92      |
| Bob Johnson      | 85      |
| Charlie Brown    | 78      |
------------------------------


**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using functions to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., a function for input, a function for writing to a file, and a function for reading and displaying data).
- Use appropriate data structures to store the input data temporarily before writing it to the file.
- Encourage writing clean, readable code with comments explaining the functionality of different sections of the code.

This project will provide hands-on experience with basic input and output operations, both through the console and with file handling, laying the foundation for more advanced programming topics.

        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

",9,"The student's code is very close to the model solution and adheres to the requirements for debugging and error handling. However, the implementation is not without minor areas of improvement, which can further enhance the readability and robustness of the code:

**1. Minor Improvement Suggestions:**

- **Owner's Name Validation:**
  Consider adding a check for the owner's name input to ensure it is not empty. This will provide a more user-friendly experience.
  ```python
  while not owner.strip():
      print(""Owner's name cannot be empty. Please enter a valid name."")
      owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
  ```

- **Consolidate Input Handling:**
  It might be beneficial to have a separate function for input handling for deposit and withdrawal amounts. This can avoid repetitive code and make future extensions easier.
  ```python
  def get_amount(operation):
      while True:
          try:
              amount = float(input(f""Enter amount to {operation}: ""))
              return amount
          except ValueError:
              print(""Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."")
  ```

- **Graceful Exit Message:** 
  Including a final balance check or summary before the exit message could enhance the application's professionalism.
  ```python
  elif choice == 4:
      account.check_balance()
      print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
      break
  ```

**2. Summary:**

- The code successfully handles invalid input scenarios using `try-except` blocks.
- Logical errors such as negative deposit or withdrawal amounts are captured.
- Input handling for choices and amounts adds robustness to the application.
- Code comments could be beneficial to explain the purpose of error handling blocks and choices.

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()

"
problem8_statement,problem8-0pt.txt,5,"The student's code maintains the basic functionality of the banking application but lacks several critical elements required for robust error handling and input validation, as outlined in the problem description. Here is an evaluation of the code and the necessary improvements:

### Identified Errors and Missing Features:
1. **Lack of Input Validation**:
   - The program directly converts input to float without validating if the input is indeed a numeric value. This will cause the program to crash if a non-numeric input is entered.
   - The account choice is not validated for representing a valid number either; incorrect inputs can lead to value conversion errors.

2. **Handling Negative or Zero Values**:
   - There are no checks to ensure deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive.
   - Withdrawal exceeding the balance should error out rather than executing the transaction.

### Error Handling Suggestions:
- **Implement try-except blocks** to catch `ValueError` when converting inputs to `float` or `int`. This will prevent crashes with invalid inputs.

- **Check conditions for the deposit and withdrawal functions**:
  - Ensure the amount is positive in the `deposit` function.
  - Ensure the requested withdrawal amount is positive and does not exceed the current balance.
   
- **Menu Selection**: Validate that the choice entered corresponds to available options.

### Code Robustness Enhancements:
- Utilize input validation and error messages to handle incorrect or unexpected inputs gracefully.

- Implement logical checks in the `withdraw` method to handle insufficient balance situations.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Modify the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods to include validation logic and feedback messages similar to the model solution.
2. Add error handling (`try-except` blocks) in the `main()` function to validate user inputs and menu choices.
3. Enhance code comments to describe the logic implemented, especially around error checks and their handling.

With these improvements, the code will better adhere to the problem statement requirements and demonstrate a more robust handling of potential errors and user input issues.","

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",5,"### Evaluation of Student's Code
The student's implementation of the Bank Application exhibits a foundational understanding of classes and functions in Python. However, it lacks several essential aspects of error management and code robustness. Below is a detailed review, suggestions, and areas of improvement:

#### **1. Lack of Error Handling**
- **Problem:** 
  - The student's code does not handle invalid input types. If the user enters text instead of a number, or invalid choices for the menu, the program will throw an error or behave unexpectedly.
- **Suggestion:** 
  - Implement `try-except` blocks to manage non-numeric inputs for both the menu choices and transaction amounts.
  - For example, surround the casting of `choice` and `amount` with `try-except` blocks to catch `ValueError`s.
  
#### **2. Input Validation**
- **Problem:**
  - There are no checks for negative deposit or withdrawal amounts, potentially leading to illogical account balances.
- **Suggestion:** 
  - Introduce checks in `deposit` and `withdraw` methods that ensure the amounts are positive. Print an error message if conditions are not met.
  
#### **3. Logic in Withdrawal Function**
- **Problem:**
  - The account can go into a negative balance since there is no check for ensuring the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Add a condition in the `withdraw` method to ensure there are sufficient funds before proceeding with the deduction.
  
#### **4. Functionality and User Experience**
- **Problem:**
  - There is no structured feedback to the user on invalid operations, leading to a potentially frustrating experience.
- **Suggestion:**
  - Provide clear feedback to users when an action cannot be completed (like insufficient funds or invalid inputs).
  
### Improvements
Here's a brief illustration of implementing part of the above suggestions:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            print(""Error: Deposit amount must be positive."")
            return
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            print(""Error: Withdrawal amount must be positive."")
            return
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
            return
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")
```

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:

Previous Score: 4

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
"
problem8_statement,problem8-2pt.txt,5,"### Summary
The student's code demonstrates a basic understanding of the banking application but lacks sufficient error handling and validation mechanisms.

### Strengths
1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Successfully implements core functionalities (deposit, withdraw, check balance, and exit).
   - Maintains a straightforward structure that covers the primary operations of a bank account.

2. **Readability**:
   - The code is neatly formatted, making it easy to read and understand.

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Error Handling**:
   - There is a lack of try-except blocks to handle invalid user inputs. It is essential to catch non-numeric inputs for both menu choices and transaction amounts, which may lead to runtime exceptions.
   
2. **Input Validation**:
   - There's no check for negative or zero amounts in the deposit and withdrawal methods. It is crucial to ensure these amounts are positive to maintain data integrity.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - `choice` input should be validated to ensure it is numeric and falls within the valid options range (1-4).
   
4. **Robustness**:
   - Implement warnings or safeguards to remind users about valid amounts and choices.
   
### Recommendations
- **Use Try-Except Blocks**:
  - Surround sensitive areas, like user inputs, with try-except blocks to catch potential exceptions, especially ValueError.
  
- **Implement Validations**:
  - Ensure that only positive numbers are accepted in the deposit and withdrawal methods. Inform the user if the input doesn’t meet this criterion.

- **Enhance User Input Handling**:
  - Before casting inputs to float or int, ensure they are numeric by checking with the `str.isdigit()` or similar functions.
  
- **Improve Feedback**:
  - Print meaningful messages to guide users in case of errors, such as invalid input submissions or choices outside the valid range.

### Conclusion
By incorporating these improvements, the robustness and user-friendliness of the banking application can be significantly enhanced. The student's efforts are commendable, but focusing on error handling and validation will lead to a more reliable and user-centric program.","

",6,"### Evaluation of Student Code

The student's implementation of the bank application requires improvements in input validation and error handling to meet robust coding standards.

#### Identified Issues:
1. **Input Type Handling:**
   - The code directly converts input strings to `float` or assumes numeric input without error handling.
   - Negative or zero amounts for both deposit and withdrawal are not checked, which should be restricted.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - There is no try-except block to handle invalid data types, especially when converting inputs to numbers.
   - Potentially invalid menu input handling lacks a number check, opting to use strings which can avoid inherent `int` conversion errors.

3. **Logical Errors:**
   - Only insufficient balance is checked during withdrawals, no check for non-positive amounts is implemented in both deposit and withdrawal scenarios.

4. **User Feedback:**
   - Lack of clear guidance when an invalid operation choice is made. Providing feedback helps guide a user to the correct operations.

#### Functional Suggestions:

- **Implement Error Handling Using Try-Except Blocks:**
  
  Add try-except blocks when converting user inputs that should be numeric, providing user feedback for invalid entries.
  
  ```python
  choice = input(""Enter your choice: "")
  
  try:
      choice = int(choice)
  except ValueError:
      print(""Invalid choice! Please enter a number between 1 and 4."")
      continue
  ```

- **Validate Transaction Amounts:**
  
  Ensure that the amounts for transactions are positive and numeric.
  
  ```python
  try:
      amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
      if amount <= 0:
          print(""Error: Deposit amount must be positive."")
          continue
  ````

- **Add Logical Checks**:
  
  For the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods, check inputs to ensure they are not only valid numbers but also suitable amounts for the operations.
  
  ```python
  def deposit(self, amount):
      if amount <= 0:
          print(""Error: Deposit amount must be positive."")
          return
      self.balance += amount
  ```

- **Print User-friendly Prompts:**
  
  When input is invalid or operations cannot be executed, always provide a clear explanation for what went wrong and how the user can correct it.


#### Summary
With these adjustments, the student's code can achieve higher robustness, allowing the program to handle unexpected inputs or errors gracefully, significantly enhancing the user experience and code reliability.","

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

",7,"### Evaluation of the Student's Code

#### Positive Aspects:
1. The student has incorporated basic exception handling by using `try-except` blocks around user inputs, reducing the chance of crashing due to invalid input.
2. The structure of the program follows good object-oriented principles, with a class handling the bank account logic separate from the user interface in the `main()` function.
3. The student has maintained a simple structure and clear flow of the program, making it easy to read and understand.

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Deposit and Withdrawal Validations:** 
   - The student code lacks validation to ensure that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive. Currently, negative deposits and withdrawals will proceed, which logically doesn't make sense in a banking context.
   - Suggested Fix:
     ```python
     def deposit(self, amount):
         if amount <= 0:
             print(""Error: Deposit amount must be positive."")
             return
         self.balance += amount
         print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")
     def withdraw(self, amount):
         if amount <= 0:
             print(""Error: Withdrawal amount must be positive."")
             return
         if amount > self.balance:
             print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
         else:
             self.balance -= amount
             print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")
     ```

2. **Comprehensive Input Validation:** 
   - While the student has handled some basic input errors, adding additional checks for valid numeric input (e.g., float conversion for amounts) can prevent the program from accepting malformed or inappropriate input.
   - The error messages for invalid input should be more specific to guide the user better.

3. **Zero Balance Check:**
   - While this isn’t a direct requirement, implementing a feature to alert the user when their balance is zero (for example, during a successful check balance operation) could enhance the usability of the application.

4. **Code Documentation:**
   - Adding comments or docstrings to explain additions or modifications made to the code, especially around error handling logic, would improve code maintainability.

#### Final Score:
- The student demonstrated an understanding of basic exception handling and program flow, earning a **score of 7 out of 10**. Improvements around validation and error messages will enhance code robustness and user experience.","

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

",6,"After reviewing the student's code, previous feedback, and the rubric, I have decided to keep the score unchanged at 6 for the following reasons:

1. **Identification of Errors and Bugs:** The student correctly identified certain input type errors through try-except blocks, which fully aligns with the rubric for this criterion.

2. **Implementation of Error Handling:** Though try-except blocks were implemented for invalid numeric inputs, the oversight in addressing negative transaction amounts undercuts full performance for this criterion.

3. **Input Validation and Negative Value Handling:** The absence of checks for positive values in both cases marks a loss in point acquisition, preventing improvement from the previous score.

4. **Code Robustness, Testing, and Scenario Coverage:** The robustness is supported by general exception handling. Testing lacks sufficient edge scenarios, preserving the status quo of half points in these areas.

5. **Documentation and User Experience:** Without clear commentaries to guide understanding and feedback directions, structure remains basic. Limited clarity in messaging correlates with the current half-point standing.

6. **Overall Solution Effectiveness and Code Readability:** Insufficient measures for handling negative inputs reflect inadequate improvement over previous output, and readability stays moderately effective with spacing needs for readability.

Overall, the score remains reflective of areas addressed and those yet requiring attention. Comprehensive solutions to identified gaps would prompt adjustment in score in future reviews.","

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

"
problem8_statement,problem8-6pt.txt,9,"The student has done a good job implementing appropriate error handling and logical checks for the banking application. However, there are a couple areas where minor improvements can be made for a perfect solution:

1. **Withdraw Method**: While the student correctly checks for sufficient funds before withdrawal, they missed implementing the check for non-positive withdrawal amounts. This logic should be consistent with the deposit method to ensure all transactions require a positive amount. Example insertion in the `withdraw` method:
   ```python
   if amount <= 0:
       print(""Error: Withdrawal amount must be positive."")
       return
   ```

2. **Code Clarity and Redundancy**: There's a redundant check in the deposit logic outside the `deposit` method. Since the method already has this check, the outer conditional statement is unnecessary.

3. **Documentation and Comments**: While the code is clean and readable, more comments explaining the error handling choices and logical checks would be helpful for someone new to reading the script.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of error handling and the nuances of implementing robust and user-friendly software.","

",8,"### Feedback on Student Code

**Strengths:**
- The student successfully implemented error handling for invalid menu choices and non-numeric inputs for deposit and withdrawal amounts.
- The student has added a proper error message for negative or zero deposit amounts, which is consistent with the expected solution.
- The code is clear, easy to follow, and well-structured, maintaining the core functionality of the banking application.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Inconsistent Handling of Negative Withdrawals:**
   - There is an inconsistency when it comes to handling negative withdrawal amounts. The `withdraw` method should also check if the amount is negative or zero and print an appropriate error message, similar to the deposit method.
   - **Suggestion:**
     ```python
     def withdraw(self, amount):
         if amount <= 0:
             print(""Error: Withdrawal amount must be positive."")
             return
         if amount > self.balance:
             print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
         else:
             self.balance -= amount
             print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")
     ```

2. **General Exception Handling:**
   - While integer conversion exceptions are adequately addressed, consider adding exception handling in places where other potential runtime errors could occur.
   - **Suggestion:** Although not strictly necessary here, highlighting the importance of broad-based exception handling is beneficial.

3. **Code Comments:**
   - Adding comments to describe changes and sections where error handling is implemented would enhance understandability for others who are reviewing or maintaining the code in the future.

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of error handling and has implemented solutions successfully. Some minor enhancements, especially with negative transaction amounts, would maximize robustness and reliability.","

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",9,"The student code is impressive and well-handled, especially regarding error checking and input validation. Here are my observations and suggestions:

### Strengths:
1. **Error Handling:**
   - The use of try-except blocks ensures smooth handling of invalid inputs. This prevents the program from crashing.
   - Validation for deposit and withdrawal ensures that only positive values are processed.
2. **Logical Structure:**
   - The logical flow of the program is clear and efficient, with robust mechanisms for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance functionality.
3. **Feedback to User:**
   - Clear user feedback for invalid amounts and successful operations keeps the user informed.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Reusability and Modularity:**
   - While the code is functional, consider extracting the repeated code handling user input for transactions into a separate method to reduce redundancy. 
     
     ```python
     def get_valid_input(prompt):
         while True:
             try:
                 return float(input(prompt))
             except ValueError:
                 print(""Invalid input! Please enter a number."")
     ```
   
2. **User Experience:**
   - Limit the input for the initial account creation to only accept non-empty strings to avoid errors or missing names in the owner's field.
     
     ```python
     while not owner.strip():
         print(""Owner's name cannot be empty."")
         owner = input(""Enter account owner's name again: "")
     ```

3. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Although the code is mostly self-explanatory, adding comments explaining the error handling blocks could further aid in code clarity and maintainability.
   
### Overall Impression:
The student's code adheres closely to good programming practices and demonstrates a solid understanding of error handling in Python. With minor improvements in modularity and input validation, it could achieve a perfect score. Well done!","

### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Debugging and Error Handling

#### Introduction

In the world of programming, encountering errors and exceptions is a common occurrence. As a developer, one of your key skills will be identifying, understanding, and resolving these issues effectively. In this exercise, you will practice debugging and error handling by working with a simple Python program. The goal is to identify errors, understand their causes, and implement solutions to make the code robust and error-free.

#### Scenario

You are provided with a Python script that simulates a simple banking application. The program allows users to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. However, the script has several bugs and lacks proper error handling. Your task is to debug the script and add appropriate error handling to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

#### Given Code


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f""Deposit successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print(""Error: Insufficient funds!"")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f""Withdrawal successful! New balance: {self.balance}"")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f""Account balance: {self.balance}"")

def main():
    print(""Welcome to the Bank Application"")
    owner = input(""Enter account owner's name: "")
    account = BankAccount(owner)

    while True:
        print(""\nChoose an option:"")
        print(""1. Deposit"")
        print(""2. Withdraw"")
        print(""3. Check Balance"")
        print(""4. Exit"")

        choice = int(input(""Enter your choice: ""))

        if choice == 1:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to deposit: ""))
            account.deposit(amount)
        elif choice == 2:
            amount = float(input(""Enter amount to withdraw: ""))
            account.withdraw(amount)
        elif choice == 3:
            account.check_balance()
        elif choice == 4:
            print(""Thank you for using the Bank Application!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice! Please try again."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()


#### Tasks

1. **Identify Errors and Bugs:**
   - Review the given code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors. Consider edge cases and typical user input scenarios.

2. **Implement Error Handling:**
   - Add error handling to manage exceptions such as invalid input types (e.g., entering text instead of numbers) and negative deposit or withdrawal amounts. Use try-except blocks where necessary.

3. **Enhance Code Robustness:**
   - Ensure that negative or zero values cannot be deposited or withdrawn.
   - Add input validation to handle non-numeric inputs for the menu and transaction amounts.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the revised program thoroughly. Consider various scenarios like invalid inputs, large transactions, and proper exit functionality.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code to explain the changes made and the purpose of each error handling block.

#### Expected Output

- The program should run without crashing due to unhandled exceptions.
- It should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- Users should be able to perform all banking operations smoothly and exit the program gracefully.

This exercise will help you gain confidence in identifying typical programming errors and implementing effective solutions to create reliable software. Happy debugging!

"
problem9_statement,problem9_solution.txt,9,"The student's implementation of the Library Management System using OOP principles is very well done. Here's a structured evaluation:

### Correct Implementations:

1. **Class Design:**
   - The `Book` class is correctly designed with private attributes (`__title`, `__author`, `__isbn`, 
   and `__available_copies`).
   
2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Getters and setters are properly implemented for each attribute, except for ISBN, which is immutable correctly.
   - Methods `borrow_book()` and `return_book()` implement the logic for borrowing and returning books accurately, handling edge cases for unavailable copies.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - The `display_details()` method succinctly outputs all relevant book details.
  
4. **Testing:**
   - Three different `Book` objects are created in the `main()` function, demonstrating the system's functionality through borrowing and returning actions.
   - Outputs match the specified sample output provided in the problem description.

5. **Code Organization and Comments:**
   - The code is well-structured and logically commented, which facilitates readability and maintenance.

### Areas for Improvement:

- **Advanced Scenarios:**
   - Could add a check in `return_book()` to avoid returning more books than originally available, adding more robustness to the code.
   
- **Report Submission:**
   - The problem description mentioned submitting a report with class design choices and challenges faced. This aspect is missing from the provided code, although not typically coded. This might be addressed in documentation or accompanying files if required.

### Overall Feedback:
The student has shown an excellent grasp of OOP concepts and adhered closely to the problem requirements, resulting in a functional and well-documented Library Management System. Minor improvements could make the solution more complete.","
Evaluate the student's code based on the problem description and the provided example solution.

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

**Submission:**

Submit your code file along with a brief report (one page) explaining your class design choices and any challenges you faced while implementing the solution.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",9,"The student's code for the Library Management System effectively implements the required functionality based on the problem description and model solution. Here's the detailed evaluation:

### Positives:
1. **Encapsulation**: The attributes in the `Book` class are properly encapsulated with private access using the double underscore (`__`) prefix.
2. **Getters and Setters**: 
   - Proper getter and setter methods are implemented for attributes like title, author, and available copies, as required.
   - ISBN is appropriately protected from modification by omitting a setter method.
3. **Functionality – `borrow_book` and `return_book` methods**:
   - Both methods function as expected, adjusting the `available_copies` based on whether a book is successfully borrowed or returned.
4. **Display Functionality**: The method `display_details` effectively outputs the book information, meeting the problem's requirements.
5. **Instantiation and Testing**:
   - The `main` function rightly creates multiple `Book` objects and tests the core functionalities like borrowing, returning, and displaying book details.

### Recommendations for Improvement:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Although minor, the setter for `available_copies` could incorporate a type check to ensure only integers are assigned, enhancing robustness.
   
2. **Code Comments and Organization**:
   - While the code is very straightforward and readable, adding comments especially in the methods might help future maintainability and understanding.

3. **Conditional Messages**:
   - Currently, the output from the `borrow_book` method is always ""Book borrowed successfully"" or ""Sorry..."". Introducing more dynamic feedback could improve user experience, such as specific details of the book borrowed or returned.

### Overall Quality:
- The student's code is well-structured, closely mimics the model solution, and demonstrates a clear understanding of OOP principles. 

Thus, I assign a score of **9 out of 10** for this implementation.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

**Submission:**

Submit your code file along with a brief report (one page) explaining your class design choices and any challenges you faced while implementing the solution.

1. **Class Design (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes for title, author, ISBN, and available copies. A constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.
   - **1 point:** The `Book` class is defined, but either the attributes are not private or the constructor is incomplete.
   - **0 points:** The `Book` class is missing or incorrectly implemented.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** Public getter and setter methods are correctly implemented for all attributes except ISBN, which has no setter. The methods ensure controlled access and modification.
   - **1 point:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but there are issues with encapsulation (e.g., ISBN has a setter).
   - **0 points:** Getter and setter methods are missing or incorrectly implemented.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly reduces available copies by 1 and handles the case where no copies are available by printing an appropriate message.
   - **0.5 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is implemented but does not handle the case of zero available copies correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `returnBook()` method correctly increases the number of available copies by 1.
   - **0.5 points:** The `returnBook()` method is implemented but has minor issues (e.g., incorrect logic).
   - **0 points:** The `returnBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `displayDetails()` method correctly prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
   - **0.5 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is implemented but does not display all required information correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** At least three `Book` objects are created with different attributes. The program demonstrates borrowing and returning functionality with updated details displayed correctly.
   - **1 point:** Some testing is done, but it is incomplete or does not fully demonstrate the required functionality.
   - **0 points:** Testing is missing or does not demonstrate the required functionality.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is well-organized, with clear and meaningful comments explaining the logic and functionality.
   - **0.5 points:** The code is somewhat organized, but comments are sparse or unclear.
   - **0 points:** The code is poorly organized, with no comments or unclear logic.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** Proper naming conventions are used for classes, methods, and variables, enhancing code readability.
   - **0.5 points:** Naming conventions are inconsistent, but the code is still understandable.
   - **0 points:** Poor naming conventions make the code difficult to understand.

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

"
problem9_statement,problem9-0pt.txt,3,"### Feedback Summary:

The student's implementation of the `Book` class is incomplete and lacks adherence to the problem requirements. Several key aspects of the object-oriented design, encapsulation, and functionality are either incorrect or missing. Below is a detailed evaluation:

### Class Design & Encapsulation:
- **Attributes**:
  - Attributes are declared inside the class but outside any functions and should use initialization via an `__init__` method for instance creation.
  - Attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation. Using double underscores (e.g., `self.__title`) is recommended to denote private attributes.

- **Initialization**:
  - The student code lacks an `__init__` constructor method, which is critical for initializing object attributes with specific values when a `Book` object is created.

### Functionality:
- **Getter and Setter Methods**:
  - Absent in the student's implementation. These methods are necessary for controlled access and modification of private attributes. 

- **Borrow and Return Methods**:
  - Basic decrement and increment logic is present for `borrow_book()` and `return_book()`. However, the `borrow_book()` method should check for the availability of copies before decrementing.

- **Display Details**:
  - The `display_details()` method is incomplete. It should print the title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

### Testing:
- **Object Creation**:
  - Book objects are created, but without initialization through a constructor, the attributes remain default.

- **Function Invocation**:
  - Methods are called for borrowing and returning a book, but due to lack of initialization, won't reflect meaningful behavior.

### Improvements Needed:
1. Implement an `__init__()` method to initialize books with specific attributes.
2. Make attributes private by using `__` and provide corresponding getter and setter methods.
3. Enhance the `borrow_book()` method to account for availability before allowing a book to be borrowed.
4. Complete the `display_details()` method to output the necessary details.
5. Refactor `main()` to demonstrate a more comprehensive scenario with actual details and state changes.","

#### **Code Structure Issues**:
- The class attributes `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `available_copies` should be private instance variables within the `__init__` constructor. Currently, they're defined as class variables, which is inappropriate for encapsulation.

#### **Functional Issues**:
1. **Initialization (constructor missing)**:
   - No constructor (`__init__`) is defined to initialize each `Book` object with its unique attributes. 
   - **Solution**: Implement 
     ```python
     def __init__(self, title, author, isbn, available_copies):
         self.__title = title
         self.__author = author
         self.__isbn = isbn
         self.__available_copies = available_copies
     ```

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Currently, there is no application of encapsulation (private attributes and getter/setter methods).
   - **Solution**:
     - Make attributes private with underscores, e.g., `self.__title`.
     - Implement getter/setter methods for `title`, `author`, and `available_copies`.

3. **Missing Functionality**:
   - Inadequate implementation of `borrow_book()` and `return_book()` methods as they do not validate the available copies or provide informative outputs.
   - **Solution**:
     ```python
     def borrow_book(self):
         if self.__available_copies > 0:
             self.__available_copies -= 1
             print(""Book borrowed successfully."")
         else:
             print(""Sorry, no copies left."")

     def return_book(self):
         self.__available_copies += 1
         print(""Book returned successfully."")
     ```

4. **Details Display**:
   - The `display_details()` method is not showing any book details.
   - **Solution**:
     ```python
     def display_details(self):
         print(f""Title: {self.__title}"")
         print(f""Author: {self.__author}"")
         print(f""ISBN: {self.__isbn}"")
         print(f""Available Copies: {self.__available_copies}"")
     ```

#### **Main Functionality Issues**:
- The method `display_details()` should be used to show initial and updated book details.
- The current `main()` function lacks the necessary sequence to effectively test the borrowing and returning of books.
- **Testing**: Implement display calls:
   ```python
   # Display initial details
   book1.display_details()

   # Borrow a book
   book1.borrow_book()
   book1.display_details()  # show updated details

   # Return a book
   book1.return_book()
   book1.display_details()  # show reverted details
   ```

#### **Final Remarks**:
- The student has major structural omissions that impact the code's efficiency and functionality.
- While there are core gaps in implementing OOP features, the student attempted the structure for borrowing and returning books, showing basic progress.
- Key Concept Focus: Encapsulation, proper class structure, and method validation for better functionality.","

### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

Rubric:
Here's a 10-point rubric for evaluating the Library Management System project based on the problem statement provided:

1. **Class Design (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes for title, author, ISBN, and available copies. A constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.
   - **1 point:** The `Book` class is defined, but either the attributes are not private or the constructor is incomplete.
   - **0 points:** The `Book` class is missing or incorrectly implemented.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** Public getter and setter methods are correctly implemented for all attributes except ISBN, which has no setter. The methods ensure controlled access and modification.
   - **1 point:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but there are issues with encapsulation (e.g., ISBN has a setter).
   - **0 points:** Getter and setter methods are missing or incorrectly implemented.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly reduces available copies by 1 and handles the case where no copies are available by printing an appropriate message.
   - **0.5 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is implemented but does not handle the case of zero available copies correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `returnBook()` method correctly increases the number of available copies by 1.
   - **0.5 points:** The `returnBook()` method is implemented but has minor issues (e.g., incorrect logic).
   - **0 points:** The `returnBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `displayDetails()` method correctly prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
   - **0.5 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is implemented but does not display all required information correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** At least three `Book` objects are created with different attributes. The program demonstrates borrowing and returning functionality with updated details displayed correctly.
   - **1 point:** Some testing is done, but it is incomplete or does not fully demonstrate the required functionality.
   - **0 points:** Testing is missing or does not demonstrate the required functionality.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is well-organized, with clear and meaningful comments explaining the logic and functionality.
   - **0.5 points:** The code is somewhat organized, but comments are sparse or unclear.
   - **0 points:** The code is poorly organized, with no comments or unclear logic.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** Proper naming conventions are used for classes, methods, and variables, enhancing code readability.
   - **0.5 points:** Naming conventions are inconsistent, but the code is still understandable.
   - **0 points:** Poor naming conventions make the code difficult to understand.

This rubric provides clear criteria for evaluating the project, ensuring that each aspect of the problem statement is addressed and assessed appropriately.

Provide the response in structured JSON format.
",3,"Upon reviewing the student's submission against the rubric and the previous feedback, the previously assigned score of 3 is justified. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

1. **Class Design (0/2 points):**
   - The student's code defines the `Book` class but lacks the implementation of private attributes and a constructor to initialize them. This is a critical component of class design in OOP, and without it, no points can be awarded.

2. **Encapsulation (0/2 points):**
   - The absence of getter and setter methods for encapsulation means this criterion is unmet.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (0.5/1 point):**
   - The `borrowBook()` method exists but needs logic to handle the case where available copies equal zero, as noted in the feedback and rubric.

4. **Returning Functionality (1/1 point):**
   - The `returnBook()` method correctly implements increasing available copies by 1.

5. **Display Details Functionality (0/1 point):**
   - The `displayDetails()` function does not display required book information, so no points are awarded.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (0/2 points):**
   - Although book objects are created, the demonstrative aspect of the coding task isn't met, particularly in showcasing the borrowing and returning functionalities with details printed as per the requirements.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (0.5/1 point):**
   - The code lacks comments, reducing clarity, but it's somewhat organized.

8. **Naming Conventions (1/1 point):**
   - Correct naming conventions have been applied, maintaining readability.

Overall, the student hasn't sufficiently addressed the main objectives outlined in the assignment or the critical feedback provided. The score of 3 encompasses the following contributions: 0.5 for borrowing functionality, 1 for return functionality, 1 for naming conventions, and 0.5 for minimal coherence in organization. To achieve a higher score, significant improvements in class design, encapsulation, functional implementation, and thorough testing are essential.","

Rubric:
Here's a 10-point rubric for evaluating the Library Management System project based on the problem statement provided:

1. **Class Design (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes for title, author, ISBN, and available copies. A constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.
   - **1 point:** The `Book` class is defined, but either the attributes are not private or the constructor is incomplete.
   - **0 points:** The `Book` class is missing or incorrectly implemented.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** Public getter and setter methods are correctly implemented for all attributes except ISBN, which has no setter. The methods ensure controlled access and modification.
   - **1 point:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but there are issues with encapsulation (e.g., ISBN has a setter).
   - **0 points:** Getter and setter methods are missing or incorrectly implemented.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly reduces available copies by 1 and handles the case where no copies are available by printing an appropriate message.
   - **0.5 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is implemented but does not handle the case of zero available copies correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `returnBook()` method correctly increases the number of available copies by 1.
   - **0.5 points:** The `returnBook()` method is implemented but has minor issues (e.g., incorrect logic).
   - **0 points:** The `returnBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `displayDetails()` method correctly prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
   - **0.5 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is implemented but does not display all required information correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** At least three `Book` objects are created with different attributes. The program demonstrates borrowing and returning functionality with updated details displayed correctly.
   - **1 point:** Some testing is done, but it is incomplete or does not fully demonstrate the required functionality.
   - **0 points:** Testing is missing or does not demonstrate the required functionality.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point)**

This rubric provides clear criteria for evaluating the project, ensuring that each aspect of the problem statement is addressed and assessed appropriately.

Previous Feedback:
The student’s code shows a basic outline of the `Book` class but lacks several required elements according to the rubric:

1. **Class Design (0/2 points):**
   - The `Book` class is defined, but attributes like title, author, ISBN, and available copies are not private, and no constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.

2. **Encapsulation (0/2 points):**
   - No getter and setter methods are provided for any attributes, violating encapsulation principles.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (0.5/1 point):**
   - The `borrow_book()` method reduces available copies, but lacks logic to handle when available copies are zero.

4. **Returning Functionality (1/1 point):**
   - The `return_book()` method correctly increases available copies, though further testing or boundary logic could strengthen it.

5. **Display Details Functionality (0/1 point):**
   - The `display_details()` method is present but incomplete, providing no book information.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (0/2 points):**
   - Test objects are created but don't demonstrate function calls showing `displayDetails()`, borrowing, and returning interactions with outputs. Minimal testing implemented.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (0.5/1 point):**
   - Code lacks comments explaining the logic or purpose of methods, affecting clarity, but the structure is somewhat coherent.

8. **Naming Conventions (1/1 point):**
   - Correct use of naming conventions improves readability.

**Overall Feedback:**
- The code needs significant expansion to align with the assignment’s requirements, particularly in class design, encapsulation, and functional demonstration. Introducing proper encapsulation, more detailed methods, and thorough testing should be prioritized.

"
problem9_statement,problem9-2pt.txt,4,"### Evaluation of Student Code:

#### Strengths:
- **Class Implementation**: The student successfully implemented a `Book` class with the necessary attributes as indicated in the problem description: `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `available_copies`.
- **Object Creation**: The student demonstrated an understanding of creating a `Book` object and accessing its attributes within the `main` method.

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Encapsulation**: 
   - The student did not make the attributes private. The attributes should be prefixed with double underscores (e.g., `__title`) to maintain encapsulation.

2. **Getter and Setter Methods**:
   - The student did not implement public getter and setter methods, which are crucial for controlled access and modification of the book attributes. Encapsulation requires these for all attributes except `isbn` since it should remain constant.

3. **Method Implementation**:
   - There is no implementation of the `borrowBook()` and `returnBook()` methods, which are necessary to manage borrowing and returning books effectively.
   - A `displayDetails()` method was not added, which could simplify printing details and encapsulate the operation within the class.

4. **Testing & Further Functionality**:
   - The student’s code does not test the borrowing or returning functionality, as these methods were not implemented.
   - It is expected to create additional book objects to fully test the Library Management System, as outlined in the requirements.

#### Recommendations:
- **Enhance Encapsulation**: Modify the attribute definitions to be private and implement the necessary getter and setter methods per encapsulation principles.
- **Implement Required Methods**: Add the `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, and `displayDetails()` methods as specified, ensuring they function as described in the problem statement.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Complete the testing section by creating multiple `Book` objects and exercising all functionality, including borrowing and returning books, to ensure robustness.
- **Improve Code Documentation and Organization**: Adding comments for code clarity and organizing the code layout following best practices would aid in readability and maintenance.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",4,"**Evaluation of Student's Code:**

The student's code successfully initializes the `Book` class with correct attributes and prints out the details of a book. However, many important aspects of OOP, such as encapsulation, accessor methods, and the required functionality for managing book borrowing and returning, are missing.

**Functional Suggestions:**
1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Ensure that the attributes (title, author, ISBN, available_copies) are private by prefixing them with double underscores, e.g., `__title`.
   
2. **Access Methods:**
   - Implement getter methods for all attributes and setter methods where applicable. Do not implement a setter for ISBN to maintain its immutability.
   ```python
   def get_title(self):
       return self.__title
   def set_title(self, title):
       self.__title = title
   # Similarly, implement for author and available_copies.
   ```

3. **Borrow and Return Functionality:**
   - Implement methods to borrow and return books, as described in the problem statement.
   ```python
   def borrow_book(self):
       if self.__available_copies > 0:
           self.__available_copies -= 1
           print(""Book borrowed successfully."")
       else:
           print(""Sorry, this book is not available for borrowing."")
   
   def return_book(self):
       self.__available_copies += 1
       print(""Book returned successfully."")
   ```

4. **Display Method:**
   - Add a `displayDetails()` method to appropriately show the book's information.
   ```python
   def display_details(self):
       print(f""Title: {self.__title}"")
       print(f""Author: {self.__author}"")
       print(f""ISBN: {self.__isbn}"")
       print(f""Available Copies: {self.__available_copies}"")
   ```

5. **Testing Across Scenarios:**
   - After fixing the above issues, demonstrate the testing of all functionalities by creating multiple book instances, borrowing, and returning operations as laid out in the original problem description.

Adding these elements will enhance the submission's robustness, maintainability, and accuracy concerning the problem requirements.","

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

"
problem9_statement,problem9-4pt.txt,7,"## Assessment of the Student's Code: Library Management System

### POSITIVES:
1. **Basic Object-Oriented Concepts**: The student has successfully demonstrated an understanding of classes and object instantiation by creating the `Book` class and `main()` function.
2. **Correct Implementation of Methods**: The `Book` class correctly includes methods to get and set book details, borrow a book, and display details.
3. **Functional Method Calls**: Usage of methods like `borrow_book()` and `display_details()` within the `main()` function highlights practical implementation.

### AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1. **Encapsulation**:
   - The attributes `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `available_copies` are public. They should be private (e.g., `self.__title`) to align with encapsulation principles.
   - There's a set method for `isbn`, which the problem statement specifies should be immutable after instantiation.

2. **Set Available Copies Logic**:
   - The `set_available_copies()` method lacks a condition to prevent setting negative copy values. Implementing this would enhance data integrity.

3. **Missing Features**:
   - The `returnBook()` functionality is not implemented, which is a requirement per the problem description.
   - Only one book instance is created and demonstrated whereas multiple instances should be used to showcase functionality.

4. **Code Documentation**:
   - The code lacks comments, which are essential for clarity and maintainability.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Make all attributes of `Book` private to ensure encapsulation.
2. Remove or modify the `set_isbn()` method to prevent ISBN changes after the object creation.
3. Add a condition in `set_available_copies` to ensure copies are not set to negative numbers.
4. Implement and test the `returnBook()` method to complete the functionality.
5. Create and demonstrate multiple `Book` objects to showcase the complete functionality as described in the guidelines.
6. Include comments within the code to provide context and explain functionality, improving readability and maintainability. 

### FINAL SCORE: 7/10
The student understands fundamental OOP principles. Improvements can be made in encapsulation, error handling, and completeness of implementation to fully meet the problem statement's specifications.","
Evaluate the student's code based on the problem description and the provided example solution.

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",6,"### Evaluation:

**Approach:**
- The student correctly created a `Book` class and implemented the required methods.
- The student demonstrated basic functionality, such as borrowing a book and displaying details, through an example scenario within the `main` function.

**Positive Aspects:**
- Code Organization: The student's code is generally well-organized and uses helpful print statements for updates.
- Adequate Functionality Coverage: Basic methods are implemented and tested within the main function.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Encapsulation: Use of Private Attributes:**
   - The class attributes (e.g., `title`, `author`) should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Suggestion: Use double underscores (`__`) to make these attributes private (`__title`, `__author`).

2. **ISBN Setter Implementation:**
   - The setter method for the ISBN should not exist since the problem states the ISBN should not change.
   - Suggestion: Remove the `set_isbn` method.

3. **Return Book Functionality:**
   - The method `return_book()` required by the problem statement is missing.
   - Suggestion: Implement a `returnBook()` method to increment `available_copies` and notify about the successful return.

4. **Input Verification in Setter Methods:**
   - Current code allows the setter for `available_copies` to accept any integer, including negative numbers.
   - Suggestion: Include a check in `set_available_copies` to ensure copies remain non-negative.

5. **Comprehensiveness of Example Scenario:**
   - The existing example only tests the borrowing functionality.
   - Suggestion: Expand the `main` to test returning books and using getter and setter methods for attributes.

6. **Comments and Documentation:**
   - The code could benefit from additional comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of each method.
   - Suggestion: Include comments explaining key sections and methods.

### Summary:

The student has covered the foundational requirements but needs to implement encapsulation correctly, add the return book method, and remove the unnecessary setter for the ISBN. Improving these aspects will advance understanding of class design and encapsulation principles. A score of 6/10 reflects the partial alignment with the problem requirements and the potential for refinement.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

**Submission:**

Submit your code file along with a brief report (one page) explaining your class design choices and any challenges you faced while implementing the solution.

",7,"### Evaluation Summary

While the student's implementation demonstrates a basic understanding of classes and method definitions, several areas need improvement in terms of encapsulation and testing. Here's a breakdown based on the rubric:

### Breakdown:

1. **Class Design (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The class `Book` is defined, but the attributes are not private. They should be prefixed with double underscores to emphasize encapsulation. 

2. **Encapsulation (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but a setter for ISBN is incorrectly present, violating the immutability stated in requirements.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly implements borrowing logic and handles zero available copies by printing a message.

4. **Returning Functionality (0 points):**
   - **Feedback:** The `returnBook()` method is completely missing, which is a significant gap in functionality.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The `displayDetails()` method successfully prints all required information.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Only one `Book` object is created, and demonstrating borrowing functionality. Testing scenarios need to be expanded to fully demonstrate all functionalities like returning books and interaction with multiple books.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The code is well-organized with clear logic, although comments are minimal. More explanations around critical sections would enhance clarity.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Naming conventions are properly followed, aiding readability.

### Recommendations:

- Encapsulate attributes by making them private and preset the unchangeable nature of the ISBN.
- Implement the missing returning functionality to meet all requirements.
- Enhance tests by creating multiple book objects and demonstrating all functionalities, including edge cases.
- Add meaningful comments describing each method's purpose and critical logic sections.","

Rubric:
Here's a 10-point rubric for evaluating the Library Management System project based on the problem statement provided:

1. **Class Design (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes for title, author, ISBN, and available copies. A constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.
   - **1 point:** The `Book` class is defined, but either the attributes are not private or the constructor is incomplete.
   - **0 points:** The `Book` class is missing or incorrectly implemented.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** Public getter and setter methods are correctly implemented for all attributes except ISBN, which has no setter. The methods ensure controlled access and modification.
   - **1 point:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but there are issues with encapsulation (e.g., ISBN has a setter).
   - **0 points:** Getter and setter methods are missing or incorrectly implemented.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly reduces available copies by 1 and handles the case where no copies are available by printing an appropriate message.
   - **0.5 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is implemented but does not handle the case of zero available copies correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `returnBook()` method correctly increases the number of available copies by 1.
   - **0.5 points:** The `returnBook()` method is implemented but has minor issues (e.g., incorrect logic).
   - **0 points:** The `returnBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `displayDetails()` method correctly prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
   - **0.5 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is implemented but does not display all required information correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** At least three `Book` objects are created with different attributes. The program demonstrates borrowing and returning functionality with updated details displayed correctly.

",6,"After reevaluating the student's code based on the rubric and the previous feedback, I've decided to adjust the score to 6 from the original 7. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Class Design (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** The class definition lacks private attributes, which is essential for proper encapsulation. Therefore, it deserves only 1 point instead of full 2.

2. **Encapsulation (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** While getters and setters are implemented, the presence of a setter for the immutable ISBN attribute reduces the score. The previous feedback correctly assigned 1 point.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** The function is correctly implemented, handling both the decrement of available books and the scenario where no books are left for borrowing.

4. **Returning Functionality (0 points):**
   - **Justification:** The absence of the `returnBook()` method means this critical requirement is unmet, justifying the zero score here.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** The method functions as expected, printing all required details appropriately.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (0.5 points):**
   - **Justification:** Although testing does take place, it's limited to only one Book object and lacks comprehensive demonstration of returning functionality and interacting with multiple books, leading to a reduction from 1 to 0.5.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** The code maintains logical structure, although additional comments explaining various sections would offer better guidance.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point):**
   - **Justification:** Conventions regarding naming are adhered to, enhancing code readability.

The adjustments reflect a more accurate assessment of the work submitted, focusing particularly on missing elements that compromise meeting all outlined tasks fully.","

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

**Submission:**

Submit your code file along with a brief report (one page) explaining your class design choices and any challenges you faced while implementing the solution.

### Evaluation Summary

While the student's implementation demonstrates a basic understanding of classes and method definitions, several areas need improvement in terms of encapsulation and testing. Here's a breakdown based on the rubric:

### Breakdown:

1. **Class Design (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The class `Book` is defined, but the attributes are not private. They should be prefixed with double underscores to emphasize encapsulation. 

2. **Encapsulation (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but a setter for ISBN is incorrectly present, violating the immutability stated in requirements.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly implements borrowing logic and handles zero available copies by printing a message.

4. **Returning Functionality (0 points):**
   - **Feedback:** The `returnBook()` method is completely missing, which is a significant gap in functionality.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The `displayDetails()` method successfully prints all required information.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Only one `Book` object is created, and demonstrating borrowing functionality. Testing scenarios need to be expanded to fully demonstrate all functionalities like returning books and interaction with multiple books.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** The code is well-organized with clear logic, although comments are minimal. More explanations around critical sections would enhance clarity.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point):**
   - **Feedback:** Naming conventions are properly followed, aiding readability.

### Recommendations:

- Encapsulate attributes by making them private and preset the unchangeable nature of the ISBN.
- Implement the missing returning functionality to meet all requirements.
- Enhance tests by creating multiple book objects and demonstrating all functionalities, including edge cases.
- Add meaningful comments describing each method's purpose and critical logic sections.

   - The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes (`__title`, `__author`, `__isbn`, `__available_copies`) ensuring encapsulation.
   
2. **Accurate Implementation of Methods:**
   - Getter and setter methods are provided for all attributes except 'ISBN', adhering strictly to the requirements.
   - Included `borrow_book` and `return_book` methods functioning correctly to modify the available copies.
   
3. **Testing and Output:**
   - The `main` function creates and tests multiple `Book` instances, effectively demonstrating the class functionality.
   - The output format aligns closely with the sample.

4. **Good use of Print Statements:**
   - Clear and concise print statements in `borrow_book()` and `return_book()` methods.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Verbose Feedback:**
   - The feedback messages in the `borrow_book()` and `return_book()` methods could be slightly more descriptive, similar to the sample output (e.g., ""Book borrowed successfully."").

2. **Method Usage:**
   - Although functionality is demonstrated and correct, a test of setting methods (e.g., updating the title or author) would further showcase understanding of the setter methods.

### Conclusion:
The student's submission meets almost all the problem requirements with minor differences in feedback messages. The code structure and logic are well-executed, hence the high score.

Suggestions have been noted for further refinement, particularly in enhancing user feedback and demonstrating the complete use of setter methods. Otherwise, a well-rounded solution demonstrating a strong understanding of the fundamental OOP principles.","

",8,"### Evaluation of Student's Code

The student has implemented a `Book` class that largely follows the problem requirements. Below is a detailed analysis and suggestions for improvements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Properly initializes all necessary attributes in the constructor.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Successfully uses private attributes, ensuring they're only accessible via getter and setter methods.
   - Correctly omits the setter for `ISBN`, maintaining immutability for that attribute.

3. **Methods Functionality:**
   - Implements `borrow_book` and `return_book` methods adequately despite using slightly different message phrasing than that suggested in the example solution.
   - Uses `display_details` effectively to print book details in a concise format.

4. **Testing and Main Function:**
   - Correctly showcases the functionality of the `Book` class by instantiating multiple books and demonstrating borrowing and returning actions.
   - Successfully calls `display_details` to print initial and updated states of the book.

### Points of Improvement:

1. **Output Message Uniformity:**
   - Consider aligning printed messages with the example given. For instance, use ""Book borrowed successfully."" instead of ""Book borrowed."" This ensures consistency but does not affect functionality.

2. **Code Readability:**
   - Providing explanatory comments within the method implementations (e.g., explaining why checks for available copies are done) could enhance clarity, especially for beginners or those unfamiliar with the logic.

3. **Function Input Validity:**
   - While not strictly necessary here, adding input validation in the `set_available_copies` (currently absent in student code) can prevent setting an invalid number of copies.

### Overall Evaluation:

The student's solution accurately meets the given problem's requirements, effectively demonstrates both OOP concepts and practical implementation in Python. The code is neat and functions well with minor improvements suggested for consistency and further clarity. Hence, a score of 8 out of 10 is appropriate.","

You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

Provide a score (1-10) and feedback in structured JSON format.
",7,"## Evaluation of the Student's Code:

### Strengths:
- **Encapsulation:** The student correctly used private attributes in the `Book` class to ensure encapsulation.
- **Correct Class Design:** The main class and methods have been set up accurately, following Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- **Functionality:** Basic class functionality (borrow, return, and display book details) works as intended.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Validation:**
   - The `set_available_copies` method should include input validation to prevent negative values for available copies. This can be done using a conditional check to ensure copies are greater than or equal to zero.
   - Suggested Improvement:
     ```python
     def set_available_copies(self, copies):
         if copies >= 0:
             self.__available_copies = copies
         else:
             print(""Error: Available copies cannot be negative."")
     ```

2. **Code Redundancy and Structure:**
   - The student has not included exception handling or verification techniques when borrowing or returning a book in the main section.
   - Suggested Improvement:
     - Add logic to handle scenarios where the book being borrowed has zero copies available:
     ```python
     print(""Attempting to borrow a book with zero copies:"")
     unavailable_book = Book(""Unavailable Book"", ""Unknown"", ""9876543210"", 0)
     unavailable_book.borrow_book()
     ```
     
3. **Informative Output Messages:**
   - Enhance the output messages to be more informative when borrowing or returning a book to avoid confusion during practical application.
   - Suggested Improvement:
     - Include book titles in success messages:
     ```python
     def borrow_book(self):
         if self.__available_copies > 0:
             self.__available_copies -= 1
             print(f""Book '{self.__title}' borrowed successfully."")
         else:
             print(f""Sorry, no copies of '{self.__title}' are currently available for borrowing."")
     ```

### Score Breakdown:
- **Functionality:** 4/4 (Fully functional according to problem requirements)
- **Code Quality:** 2/3 (Decent validation, but needs improvement in error handling)

Problem Description:
### Problem Statement: Library Management System

**Objective:**  
Design a simple Library Management System using the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including classes, objects, and encapsulation. This task will help you understand how to create and manipulate basic classes and objects.

**Problem Description:**  
You are tasked with creating a basic version of a Library Management System. The system should be able to manage books in a library. Each book in the library has the following attributes:

- **Title** (String)
- **Author** (String)
- **ISBN** (String)
- **Available Copies** (Integer)

Your main goal is to create a class `Book` that encapsulates these attributes and provides the necessary functionality to interact with them.

**Requirements:**

1. **Class Design:**
   - Create a class called `Book` with the attributes mentioned above. These attributes should be private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the `Book` object with the given title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement public getter and setter methods for each attribute (except for the ISBN, which should not be changed once set) to allow controlled access and modification of the book details.
   - Implement a method `borrowBook()` that reduces the number of available copies by 1 if there are copies available. If no copies are available, print a message indicating that the book is not available for borrowing.
   - Implement a method `returnBook()` that increases the number of available copies by 1.

3. **Additional Functionality:**
   - Implement a method `displayDetails()` that prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and the number of available copies.

4. **Testing:**
   - In the `main` method (or equivalent), create at least three `Book` objects with different attributes.
   - Demonstrate the functionality by displaying the details of each book, borrowing one book, and then displaying its details again. Also, test returning a book and display the updated details.

**Sample Output:**

plaintext
Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3

Borrowing The Great Gatsby...
Book borrowed successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 2

Returning The Great Gatsby...
Book returned successfully.

Updated Book Details:
Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
ISBN: 9780743273565
Available Copies: 3


**Guidelines:**

- Ensure that your code is well-organized and commented.
- Focus on using proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Test your program thoroughly to handle different scenarios, such as trying to borrow a book with zero available copies.

**Submission:**

Submit your code file along with a brief report (one page) explaining your class design choices and any challenges you faced while implementing the solution.

Rubric:
Here's a 10-point rubric for evaluating the Library Management System project based on the problem statement provided:

1. **Class Design (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** The `Book` class is correctly defined with private attributes for title, author, ISBN, and available copies. A constructor is implemented to initialize these attributes.
   - **1 point:** The `Book` class is defined, but either the attributes are not private or the constructor is incomplete.
   - **0 points:** The `Book` class is missing or incorrectly implemented.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** Public getter and setter methods are correctly implemented for all attributes except ISBN, which has no setter. The methods ensure controlled access and modification.
   - **1 point:** Getter and setter methods are implemented, but there are issues with encapsulation (e.g., ISBN has a setter).
   - **0 points:** Getter and setter methods are missing or incorrectly implemented.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `borrowBook()` method correctly reduces available copies by 1 and handles the case where no copies are available by printing an appropriate message.
   - **0.5 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is implemented but does not handle the case of zero available copies correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `borrowBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `returnBook()` method correctly increases the number of available copies by 1.
   - **0.5 points:** The `returnBook()` method is implemented but has minor issues (e.g., incorrect logic).
   - **0 points:** The `returnBook()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The `displayDetails()` method correctly prints the book's title, author, ISBN, and available copies.
   - **0.5 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is implemented but does not display all required information correctly.
   - **0 points:** The `displayDetails()` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points)**
   - **2 points:** At least three `Book` objects are created with different attributes. The program demonstrates borrowing and returning functionality with updated details displayed correctly.
   - **1 point:** Some testing is done, but it is incomplete or does not fully demonstrate the required functionality.
   - **0 points:** Testing is missing or does not demonstrate the required functionality.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** The code is well-organized, with clear and meaningful comments explaining the logic and functionality.
   - **0.5 points:** The code is somewhat organized, but comments are sparse or unclear.
   - **0 points:** The code is poorly organized, with no comments or unclear logic.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point)**
   - **1 point:** Proper naming conventions are used for classes, methods, and variables, enhancing code readability.
   - **0.5 points:** Naming conventions are inconsistent, but the code is still understandable.
   - **0 points:** Poor naming conventions make the code difficult to understand.

This rubric provides clear criteria for evaluating the project, ensuring that each aspect of the problem statement is addressed and assessed appropriately.

   - **Score:** 2 
   - **Feedback:** The `Book` class has been defined correctly with private attributes and a well-implemented constructor.

2. **Encapsulation (2 points):**
   - **Score:** 2 
   - **Feedback:** The getter and setter methods for title, author, and available copies are implemented accurately, and the ISBN does not have a setter, ensuring proper encapsulation.

3. **Borrowing Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Score:** 1 
   - **Feedback:** The `borrow_book()` method works as expected, decrementing available copies and outputting an appropriate message when a book is not available.

4. **Returning Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Score:** 1 
   - **Feedback:** The `return_book()` method correctly increases available copies by one.

5. **Display Details Functionality (1 point):**
   - **Score:** 1
   - **Feedback:** The `display_details()` method effectively prints all required details of the book.

6. **Testing and Demonstration (2 points):**
   - **Score:** 2
   - **Feedback:** The code includes a `main` function that demonstrates the desired functionalities: creating objects, borrowing, returning, and displaying updated book details.

7. **Code Organization and Comments (1 point):**
   - **Score:** 0.5
   - **Feedback:** The code is generally well-organized, but the comments explaining the logic could be richer in detail. More context about each function could enhance understandability.

8. **Naming Conventions (1 point):**
   - **Score:** 1
   - **Feedback:** Consistent and meaningful naming conventions are used throughout, enhancing readability.

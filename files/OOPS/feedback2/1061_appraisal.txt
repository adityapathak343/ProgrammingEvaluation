1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is not implemented, which is essential for sorting players based on their runs. This is a critical omission and results in a lack of functionality for sorting players, which is a key requirement of the assignment. (2 marks)

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class is also not implemented. This method is crucial for reading player data from a file and creating a list of `Player` objects. Without this implementation, the application cannot function as intended. (9 marks)

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is not implemented. This method is necessary for writing the updated list of players back to a file, which is another essential part of the application. (4 marks)

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is not implemented. This method is important for updating the statistics of players, and its absence means that player stats cannot be modified as required. (5 marks)

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method is not implemented. This method is needed to calculate the average runs scored by players of a specific team, which is a key functionality of the application. (5 marks)

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is not implemented. This method is necessary for filtering players by their team, which is a required feature of the application. (5 marks)

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class is not implemented. This method is essential for filtering all-rounders based on their statistics, which is another important requirement of the assignment. (5 marks)

8. The code structure and use of Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation are evident in the `Player` and `Role` classes. The use of an enum for roles enhances readability and maintainability. Additionally, method overloads and use of format strings in converting player data to CSV format showcase an understanding of Java's string manipulation capabilities.

9. The submission also demonstrates thoughtful consideration of future data handling, as indicated by the provision for separate methods dedicated to reading from and writing to files.

10. The use of `PlayerFilter` as a functional interface indicates an understanding of Java's functional programming features, even if the related methods are not implemented.

The student's performance is unsatisfactory as none of the required methods were implemented, resulting in a non-functional application. The student needs to complete all the methods to meet the assignment requirements.

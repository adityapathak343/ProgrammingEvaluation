1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented to compare players based on their runs scored in descending order. It returns the expected values based on the comparison, which is accurate. (2/2 marks)

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class is incomplete. While it initializes the list and opens the file, it does not implement the logic to read lines, split them into player data, create `Player` objects, or add them to the list. This results in a significant loss of marks. (0/9 marks)

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is not implemented at all, which means it cannot fulfill its purpose of writing player data back to a file. This is another critical omission. (0/4 marks)

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is well-implemented. It correctly iterates through the list of players, checks for a matching name, and updates the player's statistics accordingly. It also throws an exception if the player is not found, which is appropriate. (5/5 marks)

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method is correctly implemented. It filters players by team, calculates total runs, and computes the average, throwing an exception if no players are found. This method meets all requirements. (5/5 marks)

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented. It creates a list of players matching the specified team and returns it as expected. (5/5 marks)

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class is mostly correct, but it uses a less optimal comparison for the criteria. It should use `>=` instead of `>` to include players who meet the minimum criteria exactly. This is a minor issue but affects the correctness of the filtering. (3/5 marks)

Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of some concepts, particularly in the implementation of the `updatePlayerStats`, `calculateTeamAverageRuns`, and filtering methods. However, the incomplete implementations of the `readPlayersFromFile` and `writePlayersToFile` methods significantly impact the overall score. The student should focus on completing all required methods and ensuring that all logic is correctly implemented.

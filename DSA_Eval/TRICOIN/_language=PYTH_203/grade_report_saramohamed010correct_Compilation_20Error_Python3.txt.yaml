  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number of
      coins. The code first calculates the cumulative sum of coins needed for each
      row and stores it in a vector. Then it uses binary search to find the maximum
      number of rows that can be formed with the given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N) due to the binary search,
      which meets the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(N) due to the use of a vector
      to store the cumulative sum of coins needed for each row. This does not meet
      the expected space complexity as it could be optimized to O(1) by calculating
      the number of rows directly without storing the cumulative sums.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code, which makes
      it harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors. It compiles and runs
      as expected.

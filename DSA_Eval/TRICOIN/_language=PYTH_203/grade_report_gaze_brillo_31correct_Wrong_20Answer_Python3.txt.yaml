  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
      It correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the triangle that can
      be formed with the given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is not optimal for large
      inputs. The problem can be solved in O(1) time by using a mathematical formula
      to calculate the height of the triangle.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and intermediate variables.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code, which makes
      it harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and does not contain any syntax errors.
      It follows the Python syntax rules correctly.

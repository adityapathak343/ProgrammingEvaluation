  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly implements the
      logic of adding coins row by row until no more coins can be added. However,
      it does not account for the number of test cases (T), and it uses the variable
      'n' incorrectly. 'n' should be the number of test cases, and the number of coins
      should be read in each test case.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is acceptable for the
      problem constraints. The code iterates over the number of coins, adding them
      row by row until no more can be added.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      only uses a constant amount of space to store the number of coins, the current
      sum, and the current height.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the variable names are somewhat
      descriptive. However, there are no comments explaining the logic of the code,
      which makes it harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: There are major syntax errors in the code. The 'for' loop is written
      incorrectly as 'for_in' and the comparison in the while loop should use 'x'
      (the number of coins in the current test case) instead of 'n' (the number of
      test cases).

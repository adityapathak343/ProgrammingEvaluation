categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's solution is logically correct. It uses a binary search
      approach to find the maximum height of the triangle that can be formed with
      the given number of coins. The solution correctly calculates the number of coins
      needed for a given height and adjusts the search range accordingly.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the solution is O(log N), which is the time complexity
      of a binary search. This meets the expected time complexity for the problem.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant
      amount of space to store the variables. This meets the expected space complexity
      for the problem.
  code_quality:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code is well-organized and easy to read. The function and variable
      names are descriptive, and the student has used comments to explain the logic
      of the code. The code also handles the input and output as required by the problem
      statement.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct. There are no syntax errors, and it
      follows the Python coding standards.

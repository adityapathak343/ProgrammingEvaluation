  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The logic of the code is partially correct. The function 'valid' checks
      if the number of coins forms a perfect triangle. However, the problem asks for
      the maximum possible height of the triangle that can be formed with at most
      N coins, not exactly N coins. The code fails to handle cases where the number
      of coins does not form a perfect triangle.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N) due to the binary search,
      which meets the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity as it does not use any extra space that scales with input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose
      of certain parts of the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors. It compiles and runs
      as expected.

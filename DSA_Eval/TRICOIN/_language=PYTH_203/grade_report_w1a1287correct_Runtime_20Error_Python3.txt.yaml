  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The logic of the code is partially correct. The code correctly calculates
      the cumulative sum of coins used in each row. However, the code does not handle
      the case when the number of coins is less than 3. Also, the variable 'h' is
      not defined before it is incremented.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which meets the expected time
      complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code quality is acceptable. The code is reasonably organized and
      the variable names are clear. However, there are no comments in the code to
      explain the logic.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code has a few minor syntax issues. The variable 'h' is not defined
      before it is incremented. Also, the code does not handle the case when the number
      of coins is less than 3.

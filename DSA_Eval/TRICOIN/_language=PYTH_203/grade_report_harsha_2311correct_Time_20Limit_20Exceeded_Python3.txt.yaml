  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's solution is logically correct. It uses binary search to
      find the maximum height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number
      of coins. The condition checks in the while loop are correct and handle all
      possible cases.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the solution is O(log N), which is the best possible
      for this problem. The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the solution is O(1), which is optimal. The
      solution only uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments explaining the logic of the code, which would make it easier
      to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct. There are no syntax errors, and it
      follows Python's conventions for syntax and style.

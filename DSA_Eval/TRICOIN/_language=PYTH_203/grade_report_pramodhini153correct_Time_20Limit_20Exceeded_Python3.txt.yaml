  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The logic of the code is partially correct. The code correctly increments
      the number of coins in each row, but the condition for the loop and the increment
      of 's' is incorrect. The loop should continue until 's' is greater than 'n',
      and 's' should be incremented by 'i' not '(s+1)'.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is not optimal. The problem
      can be solved in O(1) time by using the formula for the sum of the first 'n'
      natural numbers and solving for 'n'.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and intermediate variables.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code quality is acceptable. The variable names are not very descriptive,
      but the code is reasonably organized. There are no comments explaining the logic
      of the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The syntax of the code is correct. There are no syntax errors, and the
      code should compile and run without any issues.

categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The logic of the code is partially correct. The code correctly calculates
      the number of coins in each row and checks if it exceeds the total number of
      coins. However, the variable 'c' is not initialized before being incremented,
      which will cause a runtime error.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which meets the problem's constraints.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the problem's
      constraints.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the variable names are clear. However,
      there are no comments explaining the logic of the code, which makes it harder
      to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: There are several syntax errors in the code. The 'for' loop is missing
      the 'in' keyword, and the variable 'c' is not initialized before being incremented.
      These errors will prevent the code from running correctly.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle using the given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(1) for the calculation of the height
      and O(T) for the number of test cases, which meets the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity.

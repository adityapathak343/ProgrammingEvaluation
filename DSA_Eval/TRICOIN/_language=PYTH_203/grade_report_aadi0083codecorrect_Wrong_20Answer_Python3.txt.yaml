categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The logic used in the code is incorrect. The code does not correctly
      calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle. The condition (n>0) and
      (n==3) will only be true when n is exactly 3, and the condition (n>0) will always
      be true when n is within the given constraints. The calculation z=(n/2) and
      print(math.floor(z)) does not correctly calculate the height of the triangle.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(1) for each test case, which meets
      the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and there are no comments to explain
      the logic. The variable names are not descriptive and do not follow standard
      naming conventions. The code could be improved by adding comments and using
      more descriptive variable names.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The code will compile and run, but the logic is incorrect. The syntax
      is mostly correct, but the use of the 'and' operator in the condition (n>0)
      and (n==3) is not correct. It should be replaced with the 'or' operator.

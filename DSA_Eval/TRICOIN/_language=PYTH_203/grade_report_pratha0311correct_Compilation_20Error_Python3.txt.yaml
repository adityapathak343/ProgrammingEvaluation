categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle by checking the number of coins required for
      each height until it exceeds the total number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is not optimal for large
      inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search or a mathematical
      formula to calculate the height directly.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal as it does
      not use any additional space proportional to the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments and does not follow Python's PEP 8 style guide (e.g., there
      should be spaces around operators).
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The code has minor syntax issues. In Python 3, 'long' is no longer available
      and 'int' should be used instead. Also, 'print' should be followed by parentheses.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The student's code does not correctly solve the problem. The code does
      not implement the logic to calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle
      using the given number of coins. The code does not use the variable 'a' which
      is supposed to hold the number of coins for each test case. The variable 'c'
      is declared but not used. The inner loop does not have any logic implemented.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code cannot be determined as the logic of
      the code is incomplete and incorrect.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is the best possible
      space complexity for this problem as the code uses a constant amount of space.
  code_quality:
    score: 0
    feedback: The code quality is poor. There are no comments, the variable names
      are not descriptive, and the code is not organized well. The code does not follow
      the problem statement's logic and does not solve the problem.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code has major syntax errors. The inner loop does not have a colon
      at the end which is a syntax error in Python. The code will not run without
      fixing this error.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The student's code has two parts. The first part is incorrect as it
      only checks if the number of coins is less than or equal to 6 and outputs 2
      or 3, which is not a correct implementation of the problem's logic. The second
      part of the code is partially correct as it tries to form a triangle by adding
      coins row by row until it exceeds the total number of coins. However, it does
      not handle the case when the number of coins is less than 3.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which meets the expected time
      complexity for this problem.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity for this problem as it does not use any additional data structures.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the variable names are clear. However,
      there are no comments in the code to explain the logic, which makes it harder
      to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The code will run without syntax errors, but the first part of the code
      is not indented properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

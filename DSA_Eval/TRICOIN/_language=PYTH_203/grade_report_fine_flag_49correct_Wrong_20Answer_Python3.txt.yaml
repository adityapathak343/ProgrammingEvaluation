categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle by subtracting the row number from the total
      number of coins until it can no longer do so.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is acceptable for the
      problem constraints.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal as it does
      not use any additional space that scales with the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the variable names are clear. However,
      there are no comments explaining the logic of the code, which could make it
      difficult for others to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors.

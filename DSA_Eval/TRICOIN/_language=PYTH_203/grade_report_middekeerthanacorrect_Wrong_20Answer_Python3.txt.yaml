  logical_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The student's solution does not correctly solve the problem. The student
      is simply dividing the number of coins by 2 and rounding the result, which does
      not correctly calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle. The correct
      approach would be to find the maximum integer 'h' such that the sum of the first
      'h' natural numbers is less than or equal to 'n'.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the student's solution is O(1) for each test
      case, which meets the expected time complexity. However, the solution is not
      logically correct.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the student's solution is O(1), which meets
      the expected space complexity. The solution does not use any additional data
      structures.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is simple and easy to read, but lacks comments and does not
      correctly solve the problem. The variable names are not descriptive, which makes
      the code harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and should run without errors.

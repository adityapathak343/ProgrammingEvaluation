categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
      It correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the triangle that can
      be formed with the given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is acceptable for the
      problem constraints. The code iterates over the range of coins only once.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and intermediate variables.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and easy to understand. However, it
      lacks comments and the variable names could be more descriptive.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors. It follows the Python
      syntax rules and should compile and run without any issues.

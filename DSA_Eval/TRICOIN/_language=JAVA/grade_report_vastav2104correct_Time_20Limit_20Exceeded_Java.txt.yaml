categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The logic of the code is incorrect. The code does not handle the case
      when the number of coins is not enough to form the next row of the triangle.
      The code will run into an infinite loop in such cases. The code also does not
      reset the 'a' and 'count' variables for each test case, which will lead to incorrect
      results for all test cases after the first one.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is not optimal. The problem
      can be solved in O(1) time complexity by using the formula for the sum of the
      first n natural numbers.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      uses a constant amount of space.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses appropriate variable names.
      However, there are no comments explaining the logic of the code, which makes
      it harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and does not have any syntax errors.

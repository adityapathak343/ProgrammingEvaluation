categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The logic of the code is incorrect. The while loop in the commented
      section is incomplete and the for loop in the main function does not correctly
      calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle. The break statement inside
      the if condition causes the loop to exit prematurely.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is not optimal. The problem
      can be solved in O(1) time by using the formula for the sum of the first n natural
      numbers.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal as it does
      not use any additional space proportional to the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code quality is acceptable. The code is reasonably organized and
      the variable names are clear. However, there are no comments explaining the
      logic of the code and there is a commented out section that should be removed.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code has some syntax issues. The while loop in the commented section
      is incomplete and the break statement inside the if condition in the for loop
      is misplaced.

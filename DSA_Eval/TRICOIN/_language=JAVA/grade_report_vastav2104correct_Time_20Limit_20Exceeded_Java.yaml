        comment: The logic is incorrect because the count variable is not reset for each test case and the loop does not break when the count exceeds the number of coins.

      strengths:
      - points: 1
        comment: The time complexity is high due to the use of a nested loop.

    score: 1
    feedback:
      strengths:
      - points: 1
        comment: The space complexity is optimal as the program only uses a few integer variables and does not use any data structures.

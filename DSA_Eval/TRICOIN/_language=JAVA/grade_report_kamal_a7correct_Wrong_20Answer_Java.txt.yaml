  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly forms the triangle
      by subtracting the number of coins used in each row from the total. However,
      it has a special case for when the number of coins is 3, which is unnecessary
      and could lead to incorrect results if the number of coins is less than 3.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which is acceptable for the
      given problem constraints.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal as it does
      not use any additional space proportional to the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments and does not follow standard Java naming conventions (class
      name should be PascalCase). The special case for when the number of coins is
      3 is also unnecessary and could be removed to simplify the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and should compile and run without
      errors.

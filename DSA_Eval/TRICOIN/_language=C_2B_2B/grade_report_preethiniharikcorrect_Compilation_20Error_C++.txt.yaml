  logical_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The logic of the code is partially correct. The formula used to calculate
      the maximum possible height of the triangle is correct, but it is not implemented
      correctly. The 'endl' should not be inside the sqrt function.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(1) for each test case, which meets
      the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the variable names are clear. However,
      there are no comments explaining the logic of the code, which makes it harder
      to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code has a minor syntax error. The 'endl' should not be inside the
      sqrt function. It should be used with the cout statement to print a newline
      character.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly calculates the
      sum of coins needed for each row and uses binary search to find the maximum
      height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number of coins. However,
      the binary search implementation is flawed. It does not correctly handle the
      case when the number of coins is not exactly equal to the sum of coins needed
      for a certain height, which may lead to incorrect results.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N) due to the binary search,
      which meets the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(N) due to the array used to store
      the sum of coins needed for each row, which meets the expected space complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses appropriate data structures.
      However, it lacks comments and the variable names could be more descriptive.
      The use of magic numbers (like 1e9) without explanation also reduces the code
      quality.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and should compile and run without
      errors.

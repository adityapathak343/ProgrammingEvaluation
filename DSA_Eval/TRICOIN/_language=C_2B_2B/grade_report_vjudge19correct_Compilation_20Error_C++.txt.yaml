  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic
      series.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(1), which is the best possible
      time complexity for this problem.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is the best possible
      space complexity for this problem.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments explaining the logic of the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The code has a minor syntax issue. The closing brace for the while loop
      is missing, which would cause the code to not compile. With this minor fix,
      the syntax would be perfect.

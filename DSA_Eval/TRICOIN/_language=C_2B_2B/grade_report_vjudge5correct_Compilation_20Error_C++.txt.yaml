categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The logic of the code is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum
      possible height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number of
      coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(N), which is acceptable for the
      problem constraints.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal as it does
      not use any extra space proportional to the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and the naming is clear. However, there
      are no comments in the code to explain the logic, which could make it difficult
      for others to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: There is a minor syntax error in the code. There is a stray '/' after
      'cin >> N;'. Removing this would make the code syntactically correct.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
      It uses binary search to find the maximum height of the triangle that can be
      formed with the given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N), which is the best possible
      for this problem. The binary search algorithm ensures that the solution is efficient.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which is optimal. The code
      only uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments that explain what each part of the code does, which makes
      it harder to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct. It compiles and runs without any
      errors.

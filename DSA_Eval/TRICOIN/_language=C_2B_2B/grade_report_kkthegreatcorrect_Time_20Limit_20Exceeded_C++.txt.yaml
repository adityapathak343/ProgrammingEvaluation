  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
      The code calculates the maximum possible height of the triangle that can be
      formed with the given number of coins using a binary search approach.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N), which meets the expected
      time complexity. The binary search approach ensures that the solution is efficient.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity. The solution does not use any additional data structures that would
      increase the space complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments and documentation that would make it easier to understand.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors. It compiles and runs
      as expected.

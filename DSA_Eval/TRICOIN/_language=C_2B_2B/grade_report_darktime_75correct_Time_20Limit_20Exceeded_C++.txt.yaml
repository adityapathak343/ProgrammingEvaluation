  logical_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The student's code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.
      It calculates the cumulative sum of coins needed for each row and uses binary
      search to find the maximum height of the triangle that can be formed with the
      given number of coins.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n) for the loop that calculates
      the cumulative sum, and O(log n) for the binary search, which is within the
      acceptable range for the problem constraints.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(n) due to the use of a vector
      to store the cumulative sum for each row. This could be improved by calculating
      the cumulative sum on the fly, which would reduce the space complexity to O(1).
  code_quality:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code is well-organized and easy to read. The use of descriptive
      variable names and consistent indentation makes the code easy to follow. However,
      the code could be improved with the addition of comments explaining the logic
      behind the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct with no errors. It compiles and runs
      as expected.

  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It uses binary search to find
      the maximum height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number
      of coins. However, there is a minor logical error in the calculation of the
      mid value. The correct calculation should be mid = (s + e) / 2, but the code
      calculates it as mid = s + e / 2, which can lead to incorrect results.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N), which meets the expected
      time complexity. The code uses binary search, which has a logarithmic time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1), which meets the expected space
      complexity. The code only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code quality is acceptable. The code is reasonably organized and
      the variable names are mostly clear. However, there are no comments in the code,
      which makes it harder to understand the logic.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The syntax of the code is perfect. There are no syntax errors and the
      code should compile and run correctly.

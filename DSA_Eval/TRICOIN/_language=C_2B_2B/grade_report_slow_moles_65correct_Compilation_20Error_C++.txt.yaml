  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It uses binary search to find
      the maximum height of the triangle that can be formed with the given number
      of coins. However, the function 'sumfunc' is not defined correctly. The variable
      'sum' is not declared before being used.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(log N) due to the binary search,
      which meets the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(1) as it uses a constant amount
      of space, which meets the expected space complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses appropriate variable names.
      However, it lacks comments and does not handle the case where the function 'sumfunc'
      is not defined correctly.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 2
    feedback: The code has a minor syntax issue. The variable 'sum' is not declared
      in the function 'sumfunc'. This will cause a compilation error.

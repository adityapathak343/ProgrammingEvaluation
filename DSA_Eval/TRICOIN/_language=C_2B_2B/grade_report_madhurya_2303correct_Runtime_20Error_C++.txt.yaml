  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly calculates the
      cumulative sum of the number of coins in each row and compares it with the total
      number of coins. However, it does not handle the case when the number of coins
      is less than 3 correctly.
  time_complexity:
    score: 1
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which meets the expected time
      complexity for the problem.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is O(n), which does not meet the expected
      space complexity for the problem. The problem can be solved with O(1) space
      complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses appropriate data structures.
      However, it lacks comments and the variable names could be more descriptive.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and should compile and run without
      any errors.

categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly calculates the
      sum of coins in each row and checks if it is less than or equal to the total
      number of coins. However, it does not stop when the sum exceeds the total number
      of coins, which can lead to incorrect results.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which does not meet the expected
      time complexity for the problem. The code iterates over the entire range of
      coins for each test case, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is also O(n), which does not meet the
      expected space complexity for the problem. The code uses two vectors of size
      n+1, which can consume a lot of memory for large inputs.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code quality is acceptable. The code is reasonably organized and
      uses clear variable names. However, it lacks comments and does not handle edge
      cases, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The syntax of the code is perfect. There are no syntax errors and the
      code compiles and runs correctly.

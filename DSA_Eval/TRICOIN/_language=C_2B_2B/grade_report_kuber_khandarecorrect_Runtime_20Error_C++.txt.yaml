categories:
  logical_correctness:
    score: 3
    feedback: The logic of the code is mostly correct. It correctly calculates the
      sum of coins in each row and checks if it is less than or equal to the total
      number of coins. However, it does not stop when the sum exceeds the total number
      of coins, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The time complexity of the code is O(n), which does not meet the expected
      time complexity for the problem. The code iterates over the entire range of
      coins for each test case, which can be inefficient for large inputs.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The space complexity of the code is also O(n), which does not meet the
      expected space complexity for the problem. The code uses two vectors of size
      n to store the number of coins and the sum of coins, which can be inefficient
      for large inputs.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is reasonably organized and uses clear variable names. However,
      it lacks comments and documentation, which can make it difficult to understand
      the logic and purpose of the code.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 4
    feedback: The code is syntactically correct and should compile and run without
      any errors.

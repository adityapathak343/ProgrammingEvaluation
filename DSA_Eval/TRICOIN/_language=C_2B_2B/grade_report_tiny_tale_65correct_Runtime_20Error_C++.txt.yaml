  logical_correctness:
    score: 0
    feedback: The student's code does not implement the logic to solve the problem.
      The code only reads the number of test cases and the number of coins for each
      test case, but does not calculate the maximum possible height of the triangle.
  time_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The code does not implement the logic to solve the problem, so it does
      not meet the expected time complexity.
  space_complexity:
    score: 0
    feedback: The code attempts to declare an array of size 1 billion, which is not
      feasible in most systems and leads to excessive space complexity.
  code_quality:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code is organized and uses clear naming conventions. However, it
      lacks comments and does not implement the logic to solve the problem.
  syntactic_correctness:
    score: 1
    feedback: The code has a major syntax error. It attempts to declare an array of
      size 1 billion, which is not feasible in most systems and will cause the code
      to fail to compile or run.
